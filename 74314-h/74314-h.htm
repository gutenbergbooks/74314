<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thirty-two years have elapsed since the appearance of Professor Sylvain Lévi’s admirable
treatise, <i lang="fr">Le théâtre indien</i>, the first adequate sketch of the origin and development of the Indian drama and
of Indian dramatic theory. Since then the discovery of important fragments of the
dramas of the great Buddhist poet Açvaghoṣa, and of the plays of the famous Bhāsa,
has thrown unexpected light on the early history of the drama in India; the question
of the origin of the drama has been the subject of elaborate investigation by Professors
von Schroeder, Pischel, Hertel, Sir W. Ridgeway, Lüders, Konow, and myself; and the
real significance and value of the Indian theory of the dramatic art have been brought
out by the labours of Professor Jacobi. The time is therefore ripe for a fresh investigation
of the origin and development of the drama in the light of the new materials available.
</p>
<p>To bring the subject matter within moderate compass, I have confined it to the drama
in Sanskrit or Prākrit, omitting any reference to vernacular dramas. I have also omitted
from the account of the theory of drama all minor detail which appeared to have no
more than the interest of ingenuity in subdivision and classification; I have had
the less hesitation in doing so, because I have no doubt that the value and depth
of the Indian theory of poetics have failed to receive recognition, simply because
in the original sources what is important and what is valueless are presented in almost
inextricable confusion. In tracing the development of the drama, I have laid stress
only on the great writers and on dramatists who wrote before the end of the first
millennium; of later works I have selected a few typical specimens for description;
it seemed needless to dwell on plays which in the main show an excessive dependence
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>on older models and on the text-books of dramatic theory, and whose chief merit, when
they have any, lies in skill and taste in versification. Valuable bibliographies of
the dramas are contained in Mr. Montgomery Schuyler’s <i>Bibliography of the Sanskrit Drama</i> (1906), and in Professor Konow’s treatise, and it has seemed needless to do more
than refer to the most important and accessible editions of the plays mentioned and
to treatises which have appeared since the publication of these works.
</p>
<p>Though the limits of space available have precluded any full investigation of the
style of the dramatists, I have not followed Professor Lévi in leaving this aspect
out of consideration. The translations given of the passages cited are intended merely
to convey the main sense; I have therefore left without discussion difficulties of
interpretation and allusion, and have resorted to prose. Verse translations from Sanskrit
sometimes attain very real merit, but normally only in a way which has little affinity
with Sanskrit poetry. H.&nbsp;H. Wilson’s versions of Sanskrit dramas in his <i>Theatre of the Hindus</i> for this reason, and also because the prose of the dramas is turned into verse, thus
fail, despite their many intrinsic merits, to convey any precise idea of the effect
of a Sanskrit drama.
</p>
<p>I am indebted to my wife for much assistance and criticism.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Indian tradition, preserved in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n12.1src" href="#n12.1">1</a> the oldest of the texts of the theory of the drama, claims for the drama divine origin,
and a close connexion with the sacred Vedas themselves. The golden age had no need
for such amusements: ignorant of all pain, the sorrow, which is as essential to the
art as joy itself, was inconceivable. The creation of the new form of literature was
reserved to the silver age, when the gods approached the all-father and bade him produce
something to give pleasure to the ears and eyes alike, a fifth Veda which, unlike
the other four, would not be the jealous preserve of the three twice-born castes,
but might be shared by the Çūdras also. Brahmā gave ear to the pleading, and designed
to fashion a Veda in which tradition (<i lang="und">itihāsa</i>) should be combined with instruction in all the ends of men. To accomplish his task
he took from the <i>Ṛgveda</i> the element of recitation, from the <i>Sāmaveda</i> song, from the <i>Yajurveda</i> the mimetic art, and from the <i>Atharvaveda</i> sentiment. Then he bade Viçvakarman, the divine architect, build a playhouse in which
the sage Bharata was instructed to carry into practice the art thus created. The gods
accepted with joy the new creation; Çiva contributed to it the Tāṇḍava dance, expressing
violent emotion, Pārvatī, his spouse, the tender and voluptuous Lāsya, while Viṣṇu
was responsible for the invention of the four dramatic styles, essential to the effect
of any play. To Bharata fell the duty of transferring to earth this celestial Veda
in the inferior and truncated form of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>.
</p>
<p>The legend is interesting for its determination to secure the <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>participation of every member of the Hindu Trinity in the creation of the new art,
and for its effort to claim that the fifth Veda of tradition was the Veda of the dramatic
art. The older tradition, recorded and exploited by the epic,<a class="noteRef" id="n13.1src" href="#n13.1">2</a> recognizes as the fifth Veda the mass of traditions, and the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> tacitly concedes this by representing the <i>Nāṭyaveda</i> as including these traditions. The legend, therefore, is not of great antiquity,
nor need we place it long before the compilation of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> itself. The date of that text is uncertain, but we cannot with any assurance place
it before the third century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> With the Indian tendency to find divine origins, it may well be that the tradition
existed much earlier, but in the absence of any corroboration that must remain a mere
hypothesis, for which no conclusive ground can be adduced. What is important is that
none of the theorists on the drama appeal to any Vedic texts as representing dramas,
whence it is natural to draw the conclusion that there was no Indian tradition extant
in their time which pointed to the preservation among the sacred texts of dramas.
Indeed, if it were worth while, the conclusion might legitimately be drawn that the
absence of any drama in the Vedic literature was recognized, since it was necessary
for the gods to ask Brahmā to create a completely new type of literature, suitable
for an age posterior to that in which the Vedas already existed.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Dialogues of the Veda</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The silence of Indian tradition is all the more remarkable because there do exist
in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> itself a number of hymns which are obviously dialogues, and which are expressly recognized
as such by early Indian tradition.<a class="noteRef" id="n13.2src" href="#n13.2">3</a> The number of such hymns is uncertain, for it is possible to add to those which clearly
bear that character others whose interpretation might be improved by assuming a division
of persons. There are, however, at least fifteen whose character as dialogues is quite
undeniable, and most of these hymns are of marked interest. Thus in x. 10 Yama and
Yamī, the primeval twins, whence in the legend are derived the races of men, engage
in debate; <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>the poet, with a more refined sentiment than the legend, is uneasy regarding this
primitive incest, and represents Yamī as intent on an effort, fruitless so far as
the hymn goes, to induce Yama to accept and make fruitful her proffered love. A tantalizing,
but certainly interesting, hymn in the same book (x. 95) gives a dialogue between
Purūravas, and the nymph Urvaçī; he rebukes her inconstancy, but does not succeed
in making her refrain from withdrawing from his gaze. In viii. 100 Nema Bhārgava utters
an appeal to Indra, to which the god is pleased to give a reply. Sometimes there are
three interlocutors; thus Agastya, the sage, has a conversation (i. 179) of an enigmatic
type with his wife, Lopāmudrā, and their son; not less obscure is the dialogue between
Indra and Vasukra, in which the wife of the latter plays a small part, in x. 28; and
in iv. 18 we have a most confused dialogue between Indra, Aditi, and Vāmadeva. Even
less intelligible is the famous debate between Indra, his wife, Indrāṇī, and Vṛṣākapi
(x. 86), each interpreter of which is able to show the absurdity of the versions of
his predecessors but seems incapable of recognizing the defects of his own. Or one
of the interlocutors may be a troop, not an individual. Thus Saramā, the messenger
of Indra, seeking the kine which have been taken away, goes to the demons, the Paṇis,
and holds with them lively debate (x. 108). The gods also have a hard business (x.
51–3) to persuade Agni, the living fire, to persevere in the tedious occupation of
bearing to them the oblations of mortals, and the dialogue in which they engage is
vivid in the extreme, extending even to the breaking of a stanza into portions for
two interlocutors. Two dialogues are of interest for their historical allusions, the
converse of Viçvāmitra and the rivers (iii. 33) which he seeks to cross, and that
of Vasiṣṭha with his sons (vii. 33), if indeed that is the correct interpretation
of the speakers of the hymn. Indra again disputes with the Maruts (i. 165 and 170),
who had disgraced themselves in his eyes by deserting him in the thick of his contest
with the demon Vṛtra, but who succeed at last in placating his anger; in the former
hymn Agastya seems also to intervene, by summing up the result at the close, and invoking
the favour of the gods for himself. Similarly the account of Viçvāmitra’s dialogue
ends with the assertion that <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>the Bharatas successfully crossed the rivers in search of booty, having won a passage
by the intercession of their priest. The interesting, but obscure, hymn (iv. 42),
in which Indra and Varuṇa seem to engage in a dispute as to their relative pre-eminence,
is clearly commented on by the poet himself, and his intervention may be suspected
even where it is not essential.
</p>
<p>Now it is clear that the tradition of the ritual literature did not know what to make
of the dialogues of the <i>Ṛgveda</i>. The genre of composition was one which died out in the later Vedic age; it is significant
that the <i>Atharvaveda</i> knows but one hymn of that type (v. 11) in which the priest, Atharvan, begs the god
for the payment due, a cow; the god is little inclined to accord his prayer, but finally
is induced to relent and to add to the guerdon due the promise of eternal friendship.
It is not in the least surprising, therefore, if we find that Yāska and Çaunaka in
the fifth century <span class="asc">B.C.</span> were at variance as to whether the hymn x. 95 was a dialogue, as the former held,
or a mere legend, as the latter believed.<a class="noteRef" id="n15.1src" href="#n15.1">4</a> In the commentary of Sāyaṇa we find that the tradition was unable to ascribe any
ritual use for nearly all the hymns; the case of x. 86 is an exception, but it is
significant that that hymn has little of a true dialogue, the three speakers rather
uttering enigmas than conversing, and it was therefore easier to fit it into the inconspicuous
part it occupies in the later ritual. We must, therefore, admit that we have in these
dialogues the remnant of a style of poetry which died out in the later Vedic period.
</p>
<p>Its original purpose is obscure, but a very interesting suggestion was made in 1869
by Max Müller in connexion with his version of <i>Ṛgveda</i> i. 165.<a class="noteRef" id="n15.2src" href="#n15.2">5</a> He conjectured that the ‘dialogue was repeated at sacrifices in honour of the Maruts
or that possibly it was acted by two parties, one representing Indra, the other the
Maruts and their followers’. In 1890 the suggestion was repeated with approval by
Professor Lévi,<a class="noteRef" id="n15.3src" href="#n15.3">6</a> who added to it the argument that the <i>Sāmaveda</i> shows that the art of music had been fully developed by the Vedic age. Moreover the
<i>Ṛgveda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n15.4src" href="#n15.4">7</a> already knows maidens who, decked in splendid raiment, dance and attract lovers,
and the <i>Atharvaveda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n15.5src" href="#n15.5">8</a> tells <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>how men dance and sing to music. There is, therefore, <i lang="la">a priori</i> no fatal objection to assuming that the period of the <i>Ṛgveda</i> knew dramatic spectacles, religious in character, in which the priests assumed the
rôles of gods and sages in order to imitate on earth the events of the heavens.
</p>
<p>The logical consequence of this doctrine is seen in Professor von Schroeder’s elaborate
theory<a class="noteRef" id="n16.1src" href="#n16.1">9</a> that the dialogue hymns, and also certain monologues, for instance x. 119, in which
Indra appears as glorifying himself in the intoxication of his favourite Soma drink,
are relics of Vedic mysteries, an inheritance in germ from Indo-European times. Ethnology
shows us the close relation of music, dance, and drama among many peoples, and the
curious phenomenon that Vedic religion knows of gods as dancers cannot be explained
satisfactorily save on the assumption that the priests were used to see performed
ritual dances, in themselves imitations of the cosmic dance in which the world was,
on one view, created. Such dances partake of the nature of sympathetic magic, and
they have an obvious parallel in the great sacrificial rites, which in the Brāhmaṇa
period are undertaken in order to represent on earth the cosmic creation. It is true
that we do not find in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> the phallic dances which in Greece and Mexico alike are held to be closely connected
with the origin of drama, but that was because the priests of the <i>Ṛgveda</i> were in many respects austere, and disapproved of phallic deities of any kind. The
dramas of the ritual, therefore, are in a sense somewhat out of the main line of the
development of the drama; the popular side has survived through the ages in a rough
way in the Yātrās well known in the literature of Bengal, while the refined and sacerdotalized
Vedic drama passed away without a direct descendant.
</p>
<p>Independent support for the view of the dialogues as mystery plays <i lang="la">in nuce</i> is given by Dr. Hertel,<a class="noteRef" id="n16.2src" href="#n16.2">10</a> whose argument is largely based on the doctrine that the Vedic hymns were always
sung, and that in singing it would have been impossible for a single singer to make
the necessary distinction between the different speakers, which would have been possible
if the hymns had not <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>been sung. The hymns, therefore, represent the beginnings of a dramatic art, which
may be compared with the form of the <i>Gītagovinda</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n17.1src" href="#n17.1">11</a> But, what is more important, he seeks to find an actual drama on an extended scale
in the <i>Suparṇādhyāya</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n17.2src" href="#n17.2">12</a> a curious and comparatively late Vedic text. In his view, accordingly, the Vedic
drama does not stand isolated; it is seen in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> only in its beginnings; the <i>Suparṇādhyāya</i> displays it en route to further development, and in the Yātrās we can see a continuation
of the old type, which aids us in following the growth from the Vedic drama of the
classical drama of India. In this regard there is a distinct divergence of view between
the two supporters of the dramatic theory, for Professor von Schroeder regards the
Yātrās as genuinely connected with the later drama, being developed in close connexion
with the cult of Viṣṇu-Kṛṣṇa and Rudra-Çiva, but as representing a different development
from the same root as the Vedic dialogues. Of this other side of the drama he finds
hints in the traditional connexion of the Gandharvas and Apsarases with the drama,
for these in his view are essentially phallic deities.
</p>
<p>There is, of course, no doubt of the possibility of the dialogues really representing
portions of the old ritual in which the priests assumed the character of gods or demons,
for there are abundant parallels for such a supposition. But there is no sufficient
ground to compel us to seek for such an explanation of these hymns; that the <i>Ṛgveda</i> contains nothing save what is connected with ritual is a postulate which is not made
by the Indians themselves, and has no justification save in the desire for symmetry.
On the contrary, it is perfectly legitimate and much more natural to regard the <i>Ṛgveda</i> as a collection of hymns, in the vast majority of cases of ritual origin, but including
some more secular poetry, to which genus alone can we reasonably attribute the battle
hymns of Viçvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha. The fact that such hymns disappear in the later
Vedic literature is then natural, for that literature represents unquestionably hymns
collected definitely for ritual uses, and therefore nothing was admitted which could
not be employed therein. To assume, therefore, that a ritual explanation must <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>be found, and to find it in ritual drama is illegitimate, and the only justification
for accepting the view in any case must lie in the fact that it affords a better explanation
of the hymn than any which can be given otherwise.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to feel any certainty that the necessary proof has been brought in
any case. The hymn ix. 112, which describes in four stanzas in a rather humorous style
the various ends of men, ending with the refrain in each case, ‘O Soma, flow for Indra’,
is transformed into the marching song of a popular festival at which mummers represent
vegetation deities and symbols of fertility are carried. The tradition knows nothing
of these happenings, and the hymn certainly suggests none to the average intelligence.
On the contrary, it seems a very natural piece of witty sarcasm, to which point is
lent by the use of the refrain, and to deny the possibility of sarcasm to the thinkers
who produce the advanced and sceptical views expressed in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> is certainly unwise.<a class="noteRef" id="n18.1src" href="#n18.1">13</a> To explain the Vṛṣākapi hymn (x. 86) as a piece of fertility magic in dramatic form
is ingenious, but unluckily it in no way contributes towards the explanation of the
hymn, and, therefore, is as valueless as the other possible explanations which have
been offered. The same condemnation must be passed on the effort to find a mimic race
at a festival described in the strange Mudgala hymn (x. 102) which if it is intelligible
at all, seems to have a mythological reference, and not to refer either to actual
or mimic races.
</p>
<p>An ingenious effort is that made to adduce ethnological parallels to prove that the
hymn x. 119, which is a straightforward monologue, placed in the mouth of Indra, celebrating
the effect of drinking the Soma, must be regarded as part of a ritual in which at
the close of the drinking of the Soma in the rite, a priest comes forward, assuming
the rôle of Indra, and celebrates in monologue the strength of the juice of the holy
plant<span class="corr" id="xd32e1609" title="Not in source">.</span> Among the Cora Indians, after a wine festival, a god is introduced showing the effects
of the drink, while a singer celebrates its potent merits. There is, however, a fatal
hiatus in the proof; the poem by itself is perfectly clear, and to seek <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>for an explanation so far-fetched is idle expenditure of energy. The same condemnation
must be expressed of the effort to find in the frog hymn (vii. 103) a song sung by
men masked as frogs, dancing as a spell to secure rain. If we grant that the hymn
is really intended as a rain spell, which is moderately probable though not proved,
it needs no further explanation whatever, and, if we do not accept this suggestion
but adopt the older view that it satyrizes in an amusing way the antics of certain
performers of the ritual, the character of the hymn as a fertility spell vanishes
at once. The errors of method are seen excellently in the fantastic conclusion that
the gambler’s hymn (x. 34), in which a gambler deplores the fatal love for the dice
which has led to his reducing even his beloved wife to ruin, is a dramatic monologue
in which dancers represent the leaping and falling dice. The dialogue of Yama and
Yamī reduces itself to a fertility drama, from which the prudishness of the Vedic
age has omitted the vital part of the union of the pair. The curious hymn, iv. 18,
which tells of Indra’s unnatural birth becomes a drama by the assumption that of thirteen
verses seven are ascribed to the poet himself. We are in fact in every case presented
with a bare possibility, which sometimes involves absurdities, and in all cases does
nothing whatever to help us in interpreting the hymns. There is nothing, it is true,
inconceivable in the view that the hymn of Saramā and the Paṇis was actually recited
by two different parties, and thus was a ritual drama <i lang="la">in nuce</i>; what is certain is that the later Vedic period knew nothing whatever of such a practice;
the only hymn in dialogue form for which it finds a use (x. 86) is assigned an employment
in which there is nothing dramatic whatever. The absurdity of the whole process reaches
perhaps its fullest exhibition in the dissertation on the hymn regarding Agastya and
Lopāmudrā (i. 179), for it becomes a fertility rite performed after the corn has been
cut; Lopāmudrā becomes ‘that which has the seal of disappearance upon it’, a feat
which is impossible in the Vedic language; the hymn itself suits far better the obvious
alternative<a class="noteRef" id="n19.1src" href="#n19.1">14</a> of ‘one who enjoys love at the cost of breaking her marital vows’. To explain the
hymns of Indra and the Maruts (i. 170, 171, and 165) we are to hold that we <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>have three scenes of a dramatic performance, which takes place at a Soma sacrifice
to celebrate the victory of Indra over the serpent Vṛtra, ending with a dance of the
Maruts, represented by youths fully armed. This weapon dance is a relic of old vegetation
ritual, the driving out of the old year, winter, or death, which is the foundation
of the dances of the Roman Salii, the Greek Kouretes, the Phrygian Korybantes, and
the German sword dancers. How can it be justifiable to spin theories thus in order
to explain hymns which are taken by themselves without serious difficulty save in
detail?
</p>
<p>It is equally impossible to find any cogency in Dr. Hertel’s arguments from the necessity
of assuming two sets of performers, since the hymns were sung and a single voice in
singing could not distinguish the interlocutors. Doubtless, if we accepted this necessity,
we would be inclined to admit <i lang="la">a priori</i> that the song would tend to be accompanied by action and by the dance, so that drama
would be on the way to development. But we do not know that the hymns of the <i>Ṛgveda</i> were always sung; on the contrary we do know with absolute certainty that, while
the verses of the <i>Sāmaveda</i> were sung (<i lang="und">gai</i>), the verses of the <i>Ṛgveda</i> were recited (<i>çaṅs</i>). True, we do not have precise information of the exact character of the recitation,
but there is not the slightest ground to suppose that a reciter could not have conveyed
by differences in his mode of recitation the distinction between two different interlocutors,
and the fact that this point is ignored in the argument is fatal to it. Moreover,
we must admit that we are wholly ignorant as to the degree in which it was desired
by the authors or reciters of these hymns to convey these differences of person. We
do not know, and the ritual text-books did not know, exactly in what way these hymns
were used. We find in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> a number of philosophic hymns; why should we not admit that a philosophic dialogue
such as that of Yama and Yamī is possible without demanding that it should be a fragment
of ritual? We have historical hymns in Maṇḍala vii; why should we turn the dialogue
of Viçvāmitra and the rivers into a drama? Why should we insist that all hymns were
composed for ritual use, when we know that ancient tales were among the things used
to pass the period immediately following the disposal of the dead, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>that during the pauses in the great horse sacrifice, performed to assert the wide
sovereignty of the king, both Brahmins and warriors sang songs to fill up the time?
We may legitimately assume that in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> we have hymns of other than directly ritual or magic purpose; the gambler’s hymn
cannot by any reasonable stretch of the imagination be taken as ritual.<a class="noteRef" id="n21.1src" href="#n21.1">15</a>
</p>
<p>It is also impossible to accept the view that the Vedic drama died out under the chilling
effect of the disapproval of the priests of fertility ritual. We find, on the contrary,
that fertility ritual is fully recognized later in the Mahāvrata ceremonial, and also
in the horse sacrifice, which are both known to the other Vedic Saṁhitās, though this
feature of the rite is not referred to, directly at least, in the <i>Ṛgveda</i>. Moreover, even if the disapproval of fertility rites had been real, why should it
have brought to a close the drama? The dialogues of Agni and the gods, of Saramā and
the Paṇis, of Varuṇa and Indra, of Indra and the singer—and perhaps Vāyu also (viii.
100), have no connexion with fertility, and this aspect of drama need not have perished.
Dr. Hertel is certainly right in demanding traces of development, not of decadence,
but his great effort to find a full drama in the <i>Suparṇādhyāya</i> must definitely be pronounced a failure. It involves an elaborate invention of stage
directions, the preparation of a list of <i lang="la">dramatis personae</i> largely on the basis of imagination, and a translation of the piece based on this
theory, which can be shown in detail to be open to the certainty of error. Add to
this the fact that there is no hint in Indian tradition that the <i>Suparṇādhyāya</i>, on the face of it a late imitation of Vedic work proper, had ever any dramatic intention
or use.
</p>
<p>A very different theory of the purpose of these hymns is that which we owe to Professors
Windisch,<a class="noteRef" id="n21.2src" href="#n21.2">16</a> Oldenberg,<a class="noteRef" id="n21.3src" href="#n21.3">17</a> and Pischel.<a class="noteRef" id="n21.4src" href="#n21.4">18</a> They represent an old type, Indo-European in antiquity, of composition of epic character,
in which the verses, representing the points of highest emotion, were preserved, and
the connecting links were in prose which was not stereotyped, and therefore <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>has not come down to us. The theory is capable of combination with the suggestion
that these hymns in dialogue were dramatic; thus Prof. Pischel explained the combination
of prose and verse in the Sanskrit drama as a relic of this early form of literature,
which thus might serve both epic and dramatic ends.<a class="noteRef" id="n22.1src" href="#n22.1">19</a> Despite the considerable vogue which the theory has at one time or other attained,
and the energetic defence of it by Professor Oldenberg, who has based upon it an elaborate
theory of the development of Indian prose, it is doubtful whether we can accept the
view.<a class="noteRef" id="n22.2src" href="#n22.2">20</a> It is a very real difficulty here also that the tradition shows no trace of knowledge
of this characteristic of the hymns, and we do not find any work actually in this
form in the whole of the Vedic literature. The alleged instances of this type, such
as those of the tale of Çunaḥçepa in the <i>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</i>, or the working up in the <i>Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa</i> of the legend of Purūravas and Urvaçī cannot possibly be made to fit the theory.
In the latter case we have a tale, which manifestly does not agree with the verses
of the <i>Ṛgveda</i>, and which is openly and obviously an attempt to work that hymn into the explanation
of the ritual; in the former we have the use of gnomic verses to illustrate a theme,
a form of literature which is preserved through the history of Sanskrit prose, and
portions of a verse narrative. The true type, verses used at the point of emotion,
especially, therefore, to give the vital speeches and replies, is thus not represented
by any text of the Vedic literature. Whether it ever existed at all in the sense postulated
by the theory, whether there are traces of it in the <span class="corr" id="xd32e1698" title="Source: Pali">Pāli</span> Jātakas, or whether its existence even there is a misunderstanding, are questions
which are not in vital connexion with the origin of Sanskrit drama, and may, therefore,
here be left undiscussed. One consideration, however, is germane; if it were necessary
to explain the Vedic dialogues by this theory, it would certainly be possible to do
so far more effectively and simply than by the theory of their being the remains of
ritual dramas. The most serious objection to both theories is that they are not really
necessary. Professor Geldner<a class="noteRef" id="n22.3src" href="#n22.3">21</a> who formerly patronized <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>the theory of Oldenberg has sought to explain the hymns in question as ballads.<a class="noteRef" id="n23.1src" href="#n23.1">22</a>
</p>
<p>Nor of course is it necessary to make any use of this theory in order to explain the
mixture of prose and verse in the Sanskrit drama. The use of prose needs no defence
or explanation; that of verse is what was essentially to be expected, in view of the
importance of song as a form of amusement as well as in worship both in Vedic times
and later, and of the fact that our extant dramas draw so largely on epic tradition,
preserved in versified texts. Nothing indeed is more noteworthy in Sanskrit literature
than the determination to turn everything, law, astronomy, architecture, rhetoric,
even philosophy into a metrical form. The theorists on the drama give no suggestion
that the prose was regarded as any less fixed in character than the verses, or that
it was not the duty of the author of the drama to be as careful in preparing the one
as the other, and the manuscript tradition of the drama does not hint at any distinction
of the two elements as regards source.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>Dramatic Elements in Vedic Ritual</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When we leave out of account the enigmatic dialogues of the <i>Ṛgveda</i> we can see that the Vedic ritual contained within itself the germs of drama, as is
the case with practically every primitive form of worship. The ritual did not consist
merely of the singing of songs or recitations in honour of the gods; it involved a
complex round of ceremonies in some of which there was undoubtedly present the element
of dramatic representation; that is the performers of the rites assumed for the time
being personalities other than their own. There is an interesting instance of this
in the ritual of the Soma purchase for the Soma sacrifice. The seller is in some versions
at the close of the ceremony deprived of his price, and beaten or pelted with clods.
Now there can be no doubt that we have here, not a reflex of a disapproval of trafficking
in Soma, but a mimic account of the obtaining of Soma from its guardians the Gandharvas,
and there is some truth in the comparison drawn <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>between the Çūdra who plays the <span class="corr" id="xd32e1731" title="Source: role">rôle</span> of the mishandled seller and the much misused Devil of the mediaeval mystery plays.<a class="noteRef" id="n24.1src" href="#n24.1">23</a> But we must not exaggerate the amount of representation; it falls very far short
of an approach to drama, a point which is overlooked by Professor von Schroeder throughout
his discussions. A drama proper can only be said to come into being when the actors
perform parts deliberately for the sake of the performance, to give pleasure to themselves
and others, if not profit also; if a ritual includes elements of representation, the
aim is not the representation, but the actors are seeking a direct religious or magic
result. It would be absurd, for instance, to treat the identification in the marriage
ritual of the husband and wife with the sky and the earth as in any sense dramatic
or to see any drama in the performance of the royal consecration, which is based carefully
on the divine consecration of Indra, doubtless in the view that thus the king was
for the time being identified with the great god, and so acquired some measure of
his prowess.
</p>
<p>In the Mahāvrata<a class="noteRef" id="n24.2src" href="#n24.2">24</a> we find elements which are of importance as indicating the materials from which the
drama might develop. The Mahāvrata is plainly a rite intended to strengthen at the
winter solstice the sun, so that it may resume its vigour and make fruitful the earth.
Now an essential part of the rite is a struggle between a Vaiçya, whose colour is
to be white, and a Çūdra, black in colour, over a round white skin, which ultimately
falls to the victorious Vaiçya. It is impossible, without ignoring the obvious nature
of this rite, not to see in it a mimic contest to gain the sun, the power of light,
the Aryan, striving against that of darkness, the Çūdra. In the face of the ethnological
parallels it is impossible also to sever this episode from the numerous forms of the
contest of summer and winter, the first represented by the white Aryan, the second
by the dark Çūdra. We have in fact a primitive dramatic ritual, and one which it may
be added was popular throughout the Vedic age. The same ceremony is also marked by
a curious episode; a Brahmin student and a hetaera are introduced as engaged in coarse
abuse of each other, and in the older form of the ritual <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>we actually find that sexual union as a fertility rite is permitted, though later
taste dismissed the practice as undesirable. The ritual purpose of this abuse is undeniable;
it is aimed at producing fertility, and has a precise parallel in the untranslatable
language employed in the horse sacrifice during the period when the unlucky chief
queen is compelled to lie beside the slaughtered horse, in order to secure, we may
assume, the certainty of obtaining a son for the monarch whose conquests are thus
celebrated.<a class="noteRef" id="n25.1src" href="#n25.1">25</a>
</p>
<p>There are, however, nothing but elements here, and we have reasonable certainty that
no drama was known. In the <i>Yajurveda</i> we have long lists of persons of every kind covering every possible sort of occupation,
and the term Naṭa, which is normally the designation of the actor in the later literature
is unknown. We find but one term<a class="noteRef" id="n25.2src" href="#n25.2">26</a> which later ever has that sense, Çailūṣa, and there is nothing whatever to show that
an actor here is meant; a musician or a dancer may be denoted, for both dancing and
singing are mentioned in close proximity.
</p>
<p>Professor Hillebrandt,<a class="noteRef" id="n25.3src" href="#n25.3">27</a> on the other hand, is satisfied that we have actual ritual drama before us, and Professor
Konow<a class="noteRef" id="n25.4src" href="#n25.4">28</a> insists that these are indeed ritual dramas, but that they are borrowed by the ritual
from the popular mime of the time, which accordingly must have known dialogue, abusive
conversation and blows, but of which the chief parts were dance, song, and music which
are reckoned in the <i>Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n25.5src" href="#n25.5">29</a> as the arts, but of which the <i>Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n25.6src" href="#n25.6">30</a> disapproves for the use of men of the three higher castes. The evidence for this
assumption is entirely lacking, and it is extremely significant that the Vedic texts
ignore the Naṭa,<a class="noteRef" id="n25.7src" href="#n25.7">31</a> whose activity belongs according to all the evidence to a later period. It is, of
course, always possible to deprecate any argument from silence, though the value of
this contention is diminished by the very remarkable enumerations of the different
forms of occupation given in the Puruṣamedha sections of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span><i>Yajurveda</i>, where in the imaginary sacrifice of men the imagination of the Brahmins appears
to have laboured to enumerate every form of human activity. But in the absence of
any proof that secular pantomime is older than religious throughout the world, and
in the absence of anything to indicate that it was so in the case of India, it seems
quite impossible to accept Professor Konow’s suggested origin of drama.
</p>
<p>Of other elements which enter into drama we find the songs of the <i>Sāmaveda</i>, and the use of ceremonial dances. Thus at the Mahāvrata maidens dance round the
fire as a spell to bring down rain for the crops, and to secure the prosperity of
the herds. Before the marriage ceremony is completed<a class="noteRef" id="n26.1src" href="#n26.1">32</a> there is a dance of matrons whose husbands are still alive, obviously to secure that
the marriage shall endure and be fruitful. When a death takes place, and the ashes
of the deceased are collected, to be laid away, the mourners move round the vase which
contains the last relics of the dead, and dancers are present who dance to the sound
of the lute and the flute; dance, music, and song fill the whole day of mourning.<a class="noteRef" id="n26.2src" href="#n26.2">33</a> Dancing is closely associated throughout the history of the Indian theatre with the
drama, and in the ritual of Çiva and Viṣṇu-Kṛṣṇa it has an important part. Hence the
doctrine which has the approval of Professor Oldenberg<a class="noteRef" id="n26.3src" href="#n26.3">34</a> and which finds the origin of drama in the sacred dance, a dance, of course, accompanied
by gesture of <span class="corr" id="xd32e1808" title="Source: pantomic">pantomimic</span> character; combined with song, and later enriched by dialogue, this would give rise
to the drama. If we further accept the view that the dialogue in prose was added from
the ritual element seen in the abuse at the horse sacrifice and the Mahāvrata, then
within the Vedic ritual we may discern all the elements for the growth of drama present.
</p>
<p>In this sense we may speak of the drama as having its origin in the Vedic period,
but it may be doubted whether anything is gained by such a proposition. Unless the
hymns of the <i>Ṛgveda</i> present us with real drama, which is most implausible, we have not the slightest
evidence that the essential synthesis of elements and development of plot, which constitute
a true <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>drama, were made in the Vedic age. On the contrary, there is every reason to believe
that it was through the use of epic recitations that the latent possibilities of drama
were evoked, and the literary form created. One very important point in this regard
has certainly often been neglected. The Sanskrit drama does not consist, as the theory
suggests, of song and prose as its vital elements; the vast majority of the stanzas,
which are one of its chief features, were recited, not sung, and it was doubtless
from the epic that the practice of recitation was in the main derived. Professor Oldenberg<a class="noteRef" id="n27.1src" href="#n27.1">35</a> admits in fact the great importance of the epic on the development of drama, but
it may be more accurate to say that without epic recitation there would and could
have been no drama at all. Assuredly we have no clear proof of such a thing as drama
existing until later than we have assurance of the recitation of epic passages by
Granthikas, as will be seen below.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The great epic of India, the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, in the whole extent of its older portions, does not recognize in any explicit manner
the existence of the drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n28.1src" href="#n28.1">1</a> The term Naṭa indeed occurs, and, if it meant actor, the existence of the drama would
be proved, but it may equally well merely denote pantomimist. This conclusion, moreover,
is strongly supported by the strange fact that, if the epic knew the drama, it should
never mention any of its characteristics or such a standing character as the Vidūṣaka.
There is, what is still more significant, even in the later parts of the epic, such
as the Çānti and Anuçāsana Parvans, no clear allusion to the art, for the passage
in the Çānti<a class="noteRef" id="n28.2src" href="#n28.2">2</a> in which Professor Hillebrandt has found an allusion to dramatic artists can perfectly
well apply to pantomimes, and in the latter text<a class="noteRef" id="n28.3src" href="#n28.3">3</a> the passage in which the commentator Nīlakaṇṭha finds comedians and dancers (<i lang="und">naṭa-nartakāḥ</i>) yields perfectly good senses as pantomimists and dancers, both occupations there
repudiated by Brahmins. To find the drama we are compelled to have recourse to the
<i>Harivaṅça</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n28.4src" href="#n28.4">4</a> which is a deliberate continuation of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, and there we have explicit evidence, for we learn of players who made a drama out
of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> legend. But this is of no importance for the purpose of determining the date of the
drama; the <i>Harivaṅça</i> is of uncertain date, but in all probability, as we have it, it cannot be placed
earlier than the second or third century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, long after the <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>time when there is no doubt of the existence of a Sanskrit drama.
</p>
<p>The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> lends no aid to the attempt to establish an early existence of drama; we hear of
festivals and concourses (<i lang="und">samāja</i>) where Naṭas and Nartakas delight themselves,<a class="noteRef" id="n29.1src" href="#n29.1">5</a> and even of the speaking of Nāṭakas;<a class="noteRef" id="n29.2src" href="#n29.2">6</a> in another passage the term Vyāmiçraka<a class="noteRef" id="n29.3src" href="#n29.3">7</a> denotes, if we believe the commentator, plays in mingled languages. But, accepting
all these references as genuine, which we are not obliged to do, the passages have
manifestly no claim to early date, for other reasons than the allusions, and leave
us again without any early evidence.
</p>
<p>But, while the epics cannot be said to know the drama, there is abundant evidence
of the strong influence on the development of the drama exercised by the recitation
of the epics. The long continued popularity of these recitations is attested throughout
the literature; at the beginning of the seventh century <span class="asc">A.D.</span><a class="noteRef" id="n29.4src" href="#n29.4">8</a> a Brahmin, Somaçarman, akin to the royal house of Cambodia, presented to a temple
in that far-off outpost of Indian civilization a complete copy of the <i>Bhārata</i>, in order that regular recitations might take place, and almost contemporaneously
Bāṇa in the <i>Kādambarī</i> depicts the queen as hastening to the temple of Çiva to hear the recitation of the
epic. Four centuries later Kṣemendra reproaches his contemporaries with their equal
eagerness to hear such recitations, and their reluctance to carry out in practice
the excellent advice contained in them. We have vivid accounts from recent time of
such recitations not only in temples but in villages, when the generosity of some
rich man has secured the presence, if need be, for three months or longer of the reciters,
Kathakas, to go over the <span class="corr" id="xd32e1912" title="Source: hugh">huge</span> poem, which claims to be an encyclopaedia of all useful knowledge as well as the
best of poems. The reciters divide themselves into two classes, the Pāṭhakas, who
repeat the poem, and the Dhārakas, who expound it in the vernacular for the edification
of the people, whose deep interest in the recitations is attested; if the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> is the epic chosen for recitation, the departure <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>of the hero into exile excites their tears and sobs, even to the interruption of the
recital; when he returns and ascends the throne the village is illuminated and garlanded.<a class="noteRef" id="n30.1src" href="#n30.1">9</a> Fortunately we have in a bas-relief<a class="noteRef" id="n30.2src" href="#n30.2">10</a> from Sānchi, which may safely be placed before the Christian era, a representation
of a group of these Kathakas. We see in it that they accompanied with music in some
degree their recitations, danced, and indicated by gestures the sentiments of the
characters they presented. We have thus something which in its nature is far from
undramatic; given the use of dialogue, the drama would be present in embryo. This
step is foreshadowed but not actually taken in the account given in the later additions
to the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n30.3src" href="#n30.3">11</a> of the first recitation of that poem. Vālmīki, the author of the narrative of Rāma’s
deeds, teaches the poem to Kuça and Lava, the children whom Sītā in exile bears to
Rāma; they enter Ayodhyā at the moment when the king performs the horse sacrifice,
and excite the curiosity of the king himself, who hears the recitation of his own
deeds by the two rhapsodes, and recognizes them for his own sons.
</p>
<p>The term Bhārata,<a class="noteRef" id="n30.4src" href="#n30.4">12</a> which is an appellation of the comedian in the later texts, attests doubtless the
connexion of the rhapsodes with the growth of the drama. It has survived in the modern
form of Bhāṭ denoting a class of reciters, who are the inheritors of a tradition of
recitation of the epics, and who are expert in genealogy, enjoy general consideration,
and by their mere presence with a caravan assure its passage in safety. The Bhāratas
must be the rhapsodes of the Bhārata tribe,<a class="noteRef" id="n30.5src" href="#n30.5">13</a> whose fame is great in the early history of India, whose special fire is known to
the <i>Ṛgveda</i>, and who have a special offering (<i lang="und">hotrā</i>) of their own. The <i>Mahābhārata</i> is the great epic of the family, preserved by their care. With the passage of time
the rhapsodes doubtless took upon them the newer art of drama. Bhavabhūti in the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> shows himself conscious of the debts owed by the drama to the epic, and the clearest
proof is now available in the dramas of Bhāsa, with their wide indebtedness to the
great epic itself.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>The term Kuçīlava, which occasionally denotes actor, is apparently derived from the
Kuça and Lava of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>; the mode of formation of the compound is indeed strange, for it is not obvious why
it should have been formed on the mode of compounds in which the first member represents
a woman’s name, but it is equally, if not more difficult, to imagine how it could
be derived from the prefix <i lang="und">ku</i> and <i>çīla</i> manners, denoting ‘of bad morals’. Weber’s attempt to compare this name with Çailūṣa
of the Vedic texts and Çilālin, who is connected with a Sūtra for Naṭas, is obviously
impossible, and it may be that the name, derived originally from Kuça and Lava, was
later by a witticism altered to Kuçīlava as a hit against the morals of the actors,
which were recognized on every hand to be bad.<a class="noteRef" id="n31.1src" href="#n31.1">14</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Grammarians</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Pāṇini<a class="noteRef" id="n31.2src" href="#n31.2">15</a> we find mention of Naṭasūtras, text-books for Naṭas, ascribed to Çilālin and Kṛçāçva;
the fact is recorded because of the formation of the names assumed by their followers,
Çailālins and Kṛçāçvins. The names are curious; it has been suggested by Professor
Lévi to see in them ironical appellations; the Kṛçāçvins are those whose horses are
meagre, with an ironic reference to the great Indo-Iranian hero Kṛçāçva, while the
Çailālins have nothing but stones for their beds in pitiful contrast with the fame
of the Vedic school of that name, whose <i>Çailāli Brāhmaṇa</i> is known to us. But we unfortunately are here as ever in no position to establish
the meaning of Naṭa, which may mean no more than a pantomime. The conclusion is important,
for Pāṇini’s date is most probably the fourth century <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, and the fact that he has no term certainly denoting drama is of significance.
</p>
<p>In Patañjali,<a class="noteRef" id="n31.3src" href="#n31.3">16</a> the author of the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, whose date is certainly to be placed with reasonable assurance about 140 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, we find much more effective evidence bearing on the existence of drama. We learn
from his criticism on a rule laid down by his predecessor Kātyāyana, as to the use
of the imperfect tense of things which a person has himself seen, that it was normal
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>to use in his time phrases describing a past event as if it had occurred before the
eyes of the speaker; we can understand this only of a character in a dramatic performance
of some kind, and it is significant that the phrase cited in illustration of the usage
is ‘Vāsudeva has slain Kaṅsa’. The reference is to the famous legend of Kṛṣṇa, son
of Vasudeva, and his wicked uncle Kaṅsa, who first sought to destroy him in his childhood,
and afterward paid the penalty of his evil deeds by death at the hands of Kṛṣṇa. This
notice receives further elucidation by a famous passage, first adduced by Weber, in
which Patañjali explains the justification of the use of phrases such as ‘He causes
the death of Kaṅsa’, and ‘He causes the binding of Bali’.<a class="noteRef" id="n32.1src" href="#n32.1">17</a> Both these deeds, the actual killing, the actual binding, are deeds of the remote
past; how then can the present be in place? The answer, we learn, is that the events
are described in the present because the sense is, not that they are being actually
done, but that they are being described. Of the modes of description no less than
three are then set out. In the first place we have the case of the Çaubhikas or Çobhanikas,
who before the eyes of the spectators actually carry out—naturally in appearance only
in the first case—the killing of Kaṅsa and the binding of Bali; they represent in
fact by action, without words, so far as this passage formally tells us, the slaying
of the wicked Kaṅsa, the binding of the evil Bali. Secondly, we have the painters;
they describe by their paintings, for on the canvases themselves we see the blows
rained on Kaṅsa and the dragging of him about; a painter, that is to say, kills Kaṅsa
and has Bali bound by painting a scene describing these incidents. Thirdly, we have
those who use words, and not action of the Çaubhika type, the Granthikas; they also,
while relating the fortunes of their subjects from their birth to their death, make
them real to the minds of their audience, for they divide <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>themselves into two parties, one set adhering to Kṛṣṇa, and one to Kaṅsa, and they
adopt different colours, the adherents of Kaṅsa black, and those of Kṛṣṇa red, though,
by what is probably an erroneous correction, the colours are ascribed in the inverse
order by many of the manuscripts.
</p>
<p>This is clear and intelligible, and it is unfortunate that it has recently been misunderstood
by Professor Lüders,<a class="noteRef" id="n33.1src" href="#n33.1">18</a> with disastrous results for the comprehension of the notice. The Çaubhikas are made
to be persons who explain to the audience shadow pictures, a view which has not even
the merit of Indian tradition, and, as will be seen below, contradicts entirely the
facts known as to the shadow play in India, where it is recorded only in late mediaeval
times. The traditional rendering in India of the statement is recorded by Kaiyaṭa,
more than a thousand years later; it is frankly obscure; Professor Lévi<a class="noteRef" id="n33.2src" href="#n33.2">19</a> renders it as meaning that the Çaubhikas are those who teach actors, representing
Kaṅsa, and so on, the mode of recitation, a version which is doubtless very difficult.
The sense accorded to it by Professor Lüders is that the Çaubhikas explain to the
audience dumb actors, a form of drama which is recorded as performed by the Jhāṁkīs
of Bombay and Mathurā in modern India, but of which in ancient times we have no certainty,
since this is the only passage which even remotely can be supposed to allude to it.
The obvious view, that of Weber,<a class="noteRef" id="n33.3src" href="#n33.3">20</a> that we have a reference to a pantomimic killing and binding, seems irresistible;
the use of the causative is explained by this fact; if Bali and Kaṅsa were persons
of to-day the simple verb would express their binding and slaying; because it is mere
actors, the causative is used, and its use denotes that the act is not now real but
an exposition of a past act. ‘He causes the binding of Bali’ <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>means ‘he describes the binding of Bali’. The only legitimate doubt on the passage
is that regarding the exact mode of performance of the Çaubhikas; the word <i lang="und">pratyakṣam</i> in the text insists that it is done before the eyes of the audience, and we may justly
assume that the Çaubhikas performed manual acts. Did they also use dialogue? There
is nothing in the passage either to show that they did or that they did not; the contrast
which follows later with Granthikas, whose medium was words, is sufficiently pointed
if they used action as well as words. The most that can be said is that Çaubhika or
Çobhanika does not obtain currency later as denoting an actor, which may tell against
the view that Patañjali is here actually alluding to drama proper. Further we cannot
go; to argue that, if he had known drama proper, he must have clearly mentioned it,
is to ignore entirely the manner of Patañjali, whose silence as to what he must have
known is as common as his incidental mention of current topics.
</p>
<p>The error of Professor Lüders in insisting on a literal interpretation of the passage
as referring to different sorts of narrators by words comes out with special clearness
as regards the second class of persons alluded to by Patañjali. That they are painters
whose canvases are living speeches was clearly recognized by the commentators in India.
Haradatta tells us in the simplest and plainest language that when men look at a picture
on which is shown the death of Kaṅsa at the hands of Vāsudeva they interpret the picture
as the slaying of the wicked Kaṅsa by the blessed Vāsudeva, and thus by the pictured
Vāsudeva cause to be slain the pictured Kaṅsa, for this is the conception which they
form as they gaze, and he adds, very naturally, that this explains the practice of
saying of artists that they cause the slaying of Kaṅsa, the binding of Bali.<a class="noteRef" id="n34.1src" href="#n34.1">21</a> It would be difficult to see how the idea could have been more forcibly expressed,
but Professor Lüders interprets it in the sense that artists occasionally explain
their own pictures to others, an idea which is not merely wholly impossible, but renders
Haradatta’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>language nonsense. On this basis he finds that the Çaubhikas added to their business
of explaining shadow pictures that of showing and explaining other pictures, in this
respect again without any support from tradition.
</p>
<p>Finally Professor Lüders denies any division of parties among the Granthikas, whose
name he derives, like the scholiasts, from the use of manuscript books in recitation,
rejecting the idea of cyclic rhapsodes suggested by Dr. Dahlmann.<a class="noteRef" id="n35.1src" href="#n35.1">22</a> The derivation is too speculative in sense to be relied upon, but there is no doubt
that the Granthikas were reciters. Their exact means of expressing the sense is not
quite clear owing to the unlucky divergence of reading in the text, and the fact that
the precise meaning of the second word in the most probable reading (<i lang="und">çabda-gaḍu-mātram</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n35.2src" href="#n35.2">23</a> is wholly unknown. It is, accordingly, wholly illegitimate to assert that they used
words alone, and on the score of that to deny that they could be said to divide themselves
into two parties, one of followers of Kaṅsa, one of adherents of Kṛṣṇa, bearing appropriate
colours. This view reduces us to the impossible theory that the division of parties
refers to the audience. Apart from all questions of regard for the Sanskrit language,
which Patañjali should be assumed capable of writing, the ludicrous result is achieved
that among a pious audience of Kṛṣṇa adorers we are to suppose that there were many
who favoured Kaṅsa, the cruel uncle whose vices are redeemed by not a single virtue,
and for whose fate Sanskrit literature, pious and devout, shows not a sign of regret.
The change of colour, which is asserted to be the only possible sense of the term
<i lang="und">varṇānyatvam</i>, wholly without ground, is referred to the spectators, who turn red with anger if
supporters of Kaṅsa, black with fear if they support Vāsudeva. Professor Hillebrandt,
who has unfortunately accepted the new theory to the extent that he believes that
there were persons who carried round pictures and explained them for a living, justly
declines to believe in the possibility of a Hindu audience containing persons who
wished the success of Kaṅsa, and he accepts the plain fact that the Granthikas took
parts. The colours he <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>explains, however, as indicating the sentiments which the two parties feel, a view
for which there is the authority of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> which ascribes to each sentiment an appropriate colour, and, accepting the reading
of Kielhorn, he is compelled to assume that the supporters of Kaṅsa on the stage showed
as the dominant sentiment fury, while those of Kṛṣṇa are reduced to manifest fear
as the sentiment of their side. But it is frankly incredible that the followers of
Kṛṣṇa, the invincible, who calmly and coolly proceeds from victory to victory culminating
in the overthrow of his wicked uncle, accomplished with ease and celerity, should
show fear as the dominant sentiment, and it is clear that on this view we should accept
the reading which inverts the descriptions,<a class="noteRef" id="n36.1src" href="#n36.1">24</a> thus allotting to the supporters of Kaṅsa the fear, to those of Kṛṣṇa the fury of
slaughter and revenge. But in this trait it is more probable, as will be seen below,
that we have a trace of the religious origin of the drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n36.2src" href="#n36.2">25</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We seem in fact to have in the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> evidence of a stage in which all the elements of drama were present; we have acting
in dumb show, if not with words also; we have recitations divided between two parties.
Moreover, we hear of Naṭas who not only recite but also sing; we find that in the
days of the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> the Naṭa’s hunger is as proverbial as the dancing of the peacock, that it was no
rare thing for him to receive blows, and that a special term, Bhrūkuṅsa, existed to
name him who played women’s parts, appropriately made up.<a class="noteRef" id="n36.3src" href="#n36.3">26</a> The <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> does not seem to recognize women as other than dancers or singers,<a class="noteRef" id="n36.4src" href="#n36.4">27</a> so that it may well be that in the infancy of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>dramatic art the rôles of women were reserved for men, though in the classical drama
this was by no means necessarily the case. We cannot absolutely prove that in Patañjali’s
time the drama in its full form of action allied to speech was present, but we know
that all its elements existed, and we may legitimately and properly accept its existence
in a primitive form.
</p>
<p>That form, from the express mention of the subjects of the dramatic exhibitions, we
may deduce to have been of the nature of a religious drama. It is difficult not to
see in the Kaṅsavadha, the death of Kaṅsa at the hands of Kṛṣṇa, the refined version
of an older vegetation ritual in which the representative of the outworn spirit of
vegetation is destroyed. Colour is given to this theory by the remarkable fact that
in one reading the partisans of the young Kṛṣṇa are red in hue, those of Kaṅsa are
black. Now as Kṛṣṇa’s name indicates black, it would be almost inevitable that the
original attribution of red to his followers should be corrected by well-meaning scribes
to black, and this explains effectively the transposition found in the bulk of the
manuscripts. In the red hue of Kṛṣṇa’s supporters as against the black of those of
Kaṅsa we probably have a distinct reminiscence of another side of the slaying of the
vegetation spirit.<a class="noteRef" id="n37.1src" href="#n37.1">28</a> The contest is often presented as one between summer and winter, and we have seen
in the Mahāvrata what is probably a primitive form of this contest; the white Vaiçya
fights with the black Çūdra for the sun, and attains possession of its symbolical
form. The red of Kṛṣṇa’s following then proclaims him as the genius of summer who
overcomes the darkness of the winter.
</p>
<p>With this view accords most interestingly the theory of the origin of the Greek drama
from a mimic conflict of summer and winter, as developed by Dr. Farnell.<a class="noteRef" id="n37.2src" href="#n37.2">29</a> In the legend of the conflict between the Boiotian Xanthos and the Neleid Melanthos
we hear that at the moment of conflict Melanthos descried a form beside his foe, whom
he taunted with bringing a friend to aid him. Xanthos turned round, and Melanthos
slew him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>The form was that of Dionysos Melanaigis, and for his intervention the Athenians rewarded
him by admission to the Apatouria, the festival of deceit. Thus the black Melanthos
with the aid of Dionysos of the black goatskin slays the fair; the dark winter destroys
the light of summer. Even in modern times in Northern Thrace<a class="noteRef" id="n38.1src" href="#n38.1">30</a> is celebrated a popular festival in which a man clad in a goatskin is hailed as king,
scatters seed over the crowd—obviously to secure fertility—and ultimately is cast
into the river, the usual fate for the outworn spirit of vegetation. In a similar
mummery performed near the ancient Thracian capital there is a band of mummers, clad
in goatskins, of whom one is killed and lamented by his wife. It is natural to deduce
hence that tragedy had its origin in a primitive passion-play performed by men in
goatskins, in which an incarnation of a divine spirit was slain and lamented, whence
the dirge-like nature of the Greek drama.
</p>
<p>The primitive Indian play differs in one essential from this suggested origin of tragedy;
the victory lies, as we have seen, with Kṛṣṇa, with the Vaiçya, not with the dark
Kaṅsa, the black Çūdra. We have, therefore, not sorrow, though there is death, and
the fact that the Sanskrit drama insists on a happy ending is unquestionably most
effectively explained if it be brought into connexion with the fact of the origin
of the drama in a passion play whose end was happiness through death, not grief. This
view has received a remarkable measure of confirmation from the discovery of the plays
of Bhāsa; that dramatist does not conform to the rule of the later theory that there
must be no slaying on the stage, but he most assuredly conforms to the principle of
the <i>Kaṅsavadha</i> that the slaying is to be of an enemy of the god; the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i>, which has erroneously<a class="noteRef" id="n38.2src" href="#n38.2">31</a> been treated as a tragedy is, on the contrary, the depicting of the deplorable fate
of an enemy of Kṛṣṇa, and we have from Bhāsa himself the <i>Bālacarita</i> which describes the death of several monsters at Kṛṣṇa’s hands, and finally of Kaṅsa
himself.
</p>
<p>In the recitation of the Granthikas divided into two parties <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>we have an interesting parallel to the place played according to Aristotle<a class="noteRef" id="n39.1src" href="#n39.1">32</a> by the dithyramb in the development of the Greek drama. Action was required neither
of the singers of the dithyramb nor of the Granthikas, but it was only necessary in
one case and the other to introduce action, and the form of the drama would be complete.
</p>
<p>Both in the Greek and the Sanskrit drama the essential fact in the contest, from which
their origin may thus be traced, is the existence of a conflict. In the Greek drama
in its development this conflict came to dominate the play, and in the Indian drama
this characteristic is far less prominent. But it is distinctly present in all the
higher forms of the art, and we can hardly doubt that it was from this conflict that
these higher forms were evolved from the simplicity of the early material out of which
the drama rose.
</p>
<p>For the religious origin of drama a further fact can be adduced, the character of
the Vidūṣaka, the constant and trusted companion of the king, who is the normal hero
of an Indian play. The name denotes him as given to abuse,<a class="noteRef" id="n39.2src" href="#n39.2">33</a> and not rarely in the dramas he and one of the attendants on the queen engage in
contests of acrid repartee, in which he certainly does not fare the better. It would
be absurd to ignore in this regard the dialogue between the Brahmin and the hetaera
in the Mahāvrata, where the exchange of coarse abuse is intended as a fertility charm.
</p>
<p>Another religious element may, it has been suggested, be conjectured as present in
the Vidūṣaka, the reminiscence of the figure of the Çūdra who is beaten in the ceremony
of the purchase of the Soma; possibly it is to this that the hideous appearance attributed
to the Vidūṣaka is due. Professor Hillebrandt<a class="noteRef" id="n39.3src" href="#n39.3">34</a> compares the history of the Harlequin who was originally a representative of the
Devil and not a figure of mirth. It may be that these factors concurred in shaping
the character of the Vidūṣaka, but the fact that he is treated as a Brahmin is conclusive
that the abusive side of his character is the more <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>important. It is to this doubtless that his use of Prākrit is due; it cannot be conceived
that a dialogue of abuse was carried on by the Brahmin in the sacred language, which
the hetaera of the primitive social conditions of the Mahāvrata could not possibly
be expected to appreciate. Professor Hillebrandt suggests indeed that there is change
in the character of the Vidūṣaka in the literature as compared with the account given
in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, but there is clearly no adequate ground for this view.
</p>
<p>There is further abundant evidence of the close connexion of the drama with religion;
it is attested in the legend of Kṛṣṇa whose feat of slaying Kaṅsa is carried out in
the amphitheatre in the presence of the public, where he defeats the wrestlers of
his uncle’s court, and finally slays the tyrant. The festival of his nativity is essentially
a popular spectacle; as developed later, in detail which has often evoked comparison
with the Nativity,<a class="noteRef" id="n40.1src" href="#n40.1">35</a> the young mother, Devakī, is shown on a couch in a stable, with her infant clinging
to her; Yaçodā is also there with the little girl, who in the legend meets the fate
intended for Kṛṣṇa by Kaṅsa; gods and spirits surround them; Vasudeva stands sword
in hand to guard them; the Apsarases sing, the Gandharvas dance, the shepherdesses
celebrate the birth, and all night is spent by the audience in gazing at the gay scene.
Kṛṣṇa, again, is the lover of the shepherdesses and the inventor of the ardent dance
of love, the Rāsamaṇḍala. Of great importance in this regard is the persistence in
popularity of the Yātrās, which have survived the decadence of the regular Sanskrit
drama. They tell of the loves of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, his favourite among the Gopīs, for
cowherdesses replace in the pastoral the shepherdesses of European idyllic poetry.
Kṛṣṇa is by no means a faithful lover, but the end is always the fruition of Rādhā’s
love for him. And in Jayadeva’s <i>Gītagovinda</i> we have in literary form<a class="noteRef" id="n40.2src" href="#n40.2">36</a> the expression of the substance of the Yātrā, lyric songs, to which must be added
the charms of music and the dance. A further consideration of the highest importance
attests the influence of the Kṛṣṇa cult: the normal <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>prose language of the drama is Çaurasenī Prākrit, and we can only suppose that it
is so because it was the ordinary speech of the people among whom the drama first
developed into definite shape. Once this was established, we may feel assured, the
usage would be continued wherever the drama spread; we have modern evidence of the
persistence of the Brajbhāshā, the language of the revival of the Kṛṣṇa cult after
the Mahomedan invasions in the ancient home of Çaurasenī, as the language of Kṛṣṇa
devotion beyond the limits of its natural home.<a class="noteRef" id="n41.1src" href="#n41.1">37</a> Mathurā, the great centre of Kṛṣṇa worship, still celebrates the Holi festival with
rites which resemble the May-day merriment of older England, and still more the phallic
orgies of pagan Rome as described by Juvenal. It is an interesting coincidence with
the comparison made by Growse<a class="noteRef" id="n41.2src" href="#n41.2">38</a> of the Holi and the May-day rites that Haraprasād Śāstrin should have found an explanation
of the origin of the Indian drama in the fact that at the preliminaries of the play
there is special attention devoted to the salutation of Indra’s banner, which is a
flagstaff decorated with colours and bunting.<a class="noteRef" id="n41.3src" href="#n41.3">39</a> The Indian legend of the origin of drama tells that, when Bharata was bidden teach
on earth the divine art invented by Brahmā, the occasion decided upon was the banner
festival (<i lang="und">dhvajamaha</i>) of Indra. The Asuras rose in wrath, but Indra seized the staff of his banner and
beat them off, whence the staff of the banner (<i lang="und">jarjara</i>) is used as a protection at the beginning of the drama. The drama was, therefore,
once connected with the ceremonies of bringing in the Maypole from the woods at the
close of the winter, but in India this rite fell at the close of the rainy season,
and the ceremony was converted into a festival of thanksgiving for Indra’s victory
over the clouds, the Asuras. The theory in itself is inadequate, but the preliminaries
of the drama are sufficient to show the extraordinary importance attached to propitiation
of the gods, a relic of the old religious service, which would be quite out of place
if the origin of the drama had been secular.
</p>
<p>The importance of Kṛṣṇa must not cause us to ignore the prominent place occupied by
Çiva in the history of the drama. <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>To him and his spouse are ascribed the invention of the Tāṇḍava<a class="noteRef" id="n42.1src" href="#n42.1">40</a> and the Lāsya, the violent and the tender and seductive dances, which are so important
an element in the representation of a play. Nor is it surprising that a god who in
the Vedic period itself is hailed as the patron of men of every profession and occupation
should be regarded as the special patron of the artists. But it is probable that this
importance in the drama is later than that of Kṛṣṇa, and it is not without significance
that Bhāsa, who is older than any of the other classical dramatists, unlike them,
celebrates in full Kṛṣṇa, and is a Vaiṣṇava, while Çūdraka, Kālidāsa, Harṣa, and Bhavabhūti
alike are adorers of Çiva in their prefaces. The <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> of Kālidāsa introduces a dancing-master who speaks of the creation of the dance by
the god and its close connexion with the drama. The sect of the Pāçupatas, adorers
of Çiva as lord of creatures, include in their ritual the song and the dance, the
latter consisting in expressing the sentiments of the devotees by means of corporeal
movement in accord with the rules of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>. In the decadent ceremonial of the Tantras the ritual includes the representation
of Çiva by men, and of his spouse as Çakti, female energy, by women.
</p>
<p>The part of Rāma in the growth of drama was certainly not less important than that
of Kṛṣṇa himself, for the recitation of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> was popular throughout the country, and has persisted in vogue. The popularity of
the story is proved to the full by the effect of the Rām-Līlā or Daçārha festival,
at which the story is presented in dumb show, children taking the places of Rāma,
Sītā, and Lakṣmaṇa before a vast concourse of pilgrims and others. No effort is made
to speak the parts, but a series of tableaux recalls to the minds of the devotees,
to whom the whole tale is familiar, the course of the history of the hero, his banishment,
his search for Sītā, and his final triumph. In Rāma’s case the influence of the epic
on the drama appears in its full development.<a class="noteRef" id="n42.2src" href="#n42.2">41</a>
</p>
<p>The religious importance of the drama is seen distinctly in <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>the attitude of the Buddhists towards it.<a class="noteRef" id="n43.1src" href="#n43.1">42</a> The extreme dubiety of the date of the Buddhist Suttas renders it impossible to come
to any satisfactory decision regarding the existence of drama at any early date, while
the terms employed, such as Visūkadassana, Nacca, and Pekkhā, and the reference to
Samajjas leave us wholly without any ground for belief in an actual drama. We see,
however, that the objection of the sacred Canon to monks engaging in the amusement
of watching these shows, whatever their nature, was gradually overcome, and it is
an important fact that the earliest dramas known to us by fragments are the Buddhist
dramas of Açvaghoṣa. With the acceptance of the drama, the <i>Lalitavistara</i><a class="noteRef" id="n43.2src" href="#n43.2">43</a> does not hesitate to speak of the Buddha as including knowledge of the drama as among
his accomplishments; the Buddha is even called one who has entered to gaze on the
drama of the Great Law. The legend is willing to admit that even in Buddha’s time
there were dramas, for Bimbisāra had one performed in honour of a pair of Nāga kings,<a class="noteRef" id="n43.3src" href="#n43.3">44</a> and the <i>Avadānaçataka</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n43.4src" href="#n43.4">45</a> a collection of pious tales, places the drama in remote antiquity. It was performed
by the bidding of Krakucchanda, a far distant Buddha in the city Çobhāvatī by a troupe
of actors; the director undertook the rôle of the Buddha himself, while the other
members of the troupe took the rôle of monks; the same troupe in a later age, under
Gautama the Buddha himself, performed at Rājagṛha, the actress Kuvalayā gaining enormous
fame, and seducing the monks, until the Buddha terminated her career by turning her
into a hideous old woman. She then repented and attained the rank of a saint. The
same idea of a play bearing on the life of the Buddha himself is preserved in another
tale in Tibet where an actor from the south sets up in rivalry with the monks in giving
representations of the life of the Buddha. These Buddhist dramas have left their imprint
on the form of the <i>Saddharmapuṇḍarīka</i>, the Lotus of the Good Law, itself, which has none of the epic character of the <i>Lalitavistara</i>, but is presented <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>as a series of dialogues in which the Buddha himself, now supernatural, is the chief,
but not the only interlocutor. The same love of the Buddhists for artistic effects
is seen in the use of music, song, dance, and some scenic effects in the ceremonial
attaching to the foundation of Thūpas in Ceylon by a prince of the royal house; the
<i>Mahāvaṅsa</i> assumes that dramas were displayed on such occasions, though this may be an anachronism.
The frescoes of <span class="corr" id="xd32e2316" title="Source: Ajaṇṭā">Ajantā</span> show the keen appreciation felt for music, song, and the dance, though they date
from a time when there is certain evidence of the full existence of the drama. We
find also in Tibet<a class="noteRef" id="n44.1src" href="#n44.1">46</a> the relics of ancient popular religious plays in the contests between the spirits
of good and those of evil for mankind, which are part of the spring and autumn festivals.
The actors wear strange garments and masks; monks represent the good spirits, laymen
the evil spirits of men. The whole company first sings prayers and benedictions; then
an evil spirit seeks to seduce into evil a man; he would yield but for the intervention
of his friends; the evil spirits then arrive in force, a struggle ensues, in which
the men would be defeated but for the intervention of the good spirits, and the whole
ends with the chasing away with blows of the representatives of the spirits of evil.
</p>
<p>With Jainism it is as with Buddhism; we find censure of such ideal enjoyments as the
arts akin to the drama, but also recognition of song, music, dance, and scenic presentations
in the Canon.<a class="noteRef" id="n44.2src" href="#n44.2">47</a> But it is hopeless, in view of the utter uncertainty of the date of that collection,
to draw any conclusion from it as to the age of the drama. As in the case of Buddhism,
Jainism in its development was glad to have recourse to the drama as a means of propagating
its beliefs.<a class="noteRef" id="n44.3src" href="#n44.3">48</a>
</p>
<p>The evidence is conclusive on the close connexion of religion and the drama, and it
strongly suggests that it was from religion <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>that the decisive impulse to dramatic creation was given. The importance of the epic
is doubtless enormous, but the mere recitation of the epics, however closely it might
approach to the drama, does not overstep the bounds. The element which fails to be
added is that of the dramatic contest, the Agon of the Greek drama. That this was
supplied by the development of such primitive vegetation rituals as that of the Mahāvrata,
until they assumed the concrete and human form of the Kṛṣṇa and Kaṅsa legend would
be a conjecture worth consideration, but without possibility of proof if we had not
the notice of the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> which expressly shows that the story of Kṛṣṇa and Kaṅsa could both be represented
by Granthikas, who coloured their faces and expressed vividly the emotions of those
whom they represented, but also, in dumb show seemingly, by Çaubhikas. If there did
not exist an Indian drama proper, in which these sides were combined when Patañjali
wrote, it is fair to say that it would be surprising if it did not develop shortly
afterwards, and we have perfectly certain proof that the Naṭas of Patañjali were much
more than dancers or acrobats; they sang and recited. The balance of probability,
therefore, is that the Sanskrit drama came into being shortly after, if not before,
the middle of the second century <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, and that it was evoked by the combination of epic recitations with the dramatic
moment of the Kṛṣṇa legend, in which a young god strives against and overcomes enemies.
</p>
<p>The drama which was nascent in Patañjali’s time must be taken to have been, like the
classical drama, one in which Sanskrit was mingled with Prākrit in the speeches of
the characters. The epic recitations of the slaying of Kaṅsa which he records must
have been in Sanskrit, but, if the drama was to be popular—and the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> in its tale of the origin of the art recognizes both its epic and popular characteristics,
the humble people who figured in it must have been allowed to speak in their own vernacular;
this accords brilliantly with the presence of Çaurasenī as the normal prose of the
drama of the classical stage. A different view is taken by Professor Lévi,<a class="noteRef" id="n45.1src" href="#n45.1">49</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>who conceives that the drama sprang first into being in Prākrit, while Sanskrit was
only later applied at the time when Sanskrit, long reserved as a sacred language,
re-entered into use as the language of literature; India, he contends, was never anxious
for contact with reality, and it is absurd to suppose that the mixture of languages
was adopted as a representation of the actual speech-usage of the time and circles
in which drama came into being. This contention is supported by the observation that
a number of the technical terms of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> are of strange appearance, and the frequency of cerebral letters in them suggests
Prākrit origin. The contention can hardly be treated as satisfactory, nor is it clear
how it can possibly be reconciled with the evidence of Patañjali. The early drama,
it seems clear, was not secular in origin, and Professor Lévi emphasizes its dependence
on the cult of Kṛṣṇa; to refuse to use Sanskrit in it, therefore, would be extremely
strange, unless we are to assume that the existence of true drama goes back to a period
considerably earlier than Patañjali, and that it came into being among a milieu which
was not Brahminical. There are very serious difficulties in such a theory; we may
legitimately hold that such a literary form as the true drama was not created until
the Brahmin genius fused the ethic and religious agonistic motives into a new creation
of the highest importance for the literary history of India. The presence of a number
of Prākrit terms in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> is probable, but it does not mean that a theory of drama was first excogitated in
Prākrit; the main theory in all its essentials is expressed in Sanskrit, and all that
is borrowed from Prākrit is some technical terms of subsidiary importance, borrowed,
doubtless, from the minor arts, which go to aid but do not constitute the drama, song,
music, dancing, and the mimetic art.
</p>
<p>The religious origin of the Sanskrit drama in Kṛṣṇa worship is also admitted as part,
however, of a wider thesis by Dr. Ridgeway,<a class="noteRef" id="n46.1src" href="#n46.1">50</a> who contends that Greek drama, and drama all over the world, are the outcome of the
reverence paid to the spirits <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>of the dead, which again is the source of all religion, a revival in fact of the doctrine
of animism in one of its connotations. The contention as applied to the Indian drama
involves the view that the actors in the primitive drama were representatives of the
spirits of the dead, and that the performance was meant to gratify the dead. It is
supported by the doctrine that not only Rāma and Kṛṣṇa were believed once to be men,
but that Çiva himself had this origin;<a class="noteRef" id="n47.1src" href="#n47.1">51</a> all gods indeed are derived from the memory of noble men. The evidence adduced for
this thesis is simply non-existent. A valuable collection of material due to Sir J.&nbsp;H.
Marshall proves the prevalence throughout India of popular dramatic performances celebrating
the deeds of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, and the modern Indian drama deals also with the lives
of distinguished historical characters such as Açoka or Candragupta. But there is
nothing to show that the idea of gratifying the dead by the performances of dramatic
scenes based on their history was ever present to any mind in India, either early
or late. Rāma and Kṛṣṇa to their worshippers were long before the rise of so late
an art as drama, just like Çiva, great gods, of whom it would be absurd to think as
dead men requiring funeral rites to give them pleasure. Nor is it necessary further
to criticize his reconstruction of Vedic religion on the basis of his animistic theory,
for these issues of origins have no possible relevance to the specific question of
the origin of the Indian drama. Whether elsewhere the worship of the dead resulted
in drama is a matter open to grave doubt; certainly in the case of the Greek drama,
which offers the most interesting parallel to that of India, the evidence of derivation
from funeral games is wholly defective.
</p>
<p>Definite support for this view of the origin of drama may be found in the accounts
of dramatic performances which are given in the <i>Harivaṅça</i>, the supplement of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>. That work cannot, as has been mentioned, be dated with any certainty or probability
earlier than the dramas of Açvaghoṣa, and, therefore, it cannot be appealed to as
the earliest mention now extant of the dramatic art. But it is of value as showing
how closely <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>connected the drama was in early times with the Kṛṣṇa cult, thus supplementing the
conclusions to be derived from the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, and falling into line with the evidence of Bhāsa.
</p>
<p>At the festival performed by the Yādavas after the death of Andhaka, we find that
the women of the place danced and sang to music, while Kṛṣṇa induced celestial nymphs
to aid the merriment by similar exhibitions, including a representation by the Apsarases,
apparently by dancing, of the death of Kaṅsa and Pralamba, the fall of Cāṇūra in the
amphitheatre, and various other exploits of Kṛṣṇa. After they had performed, the sage
Nārada amused the audience by a series of what may fairly be called comic turns; he
imitated the gestures, the movements, and even the laughter of such distinguished
personages as Satyabhāmā, Keçava, Arjuna, Baladeva, and the young princess, the daughter
of Revata, causing infinite amusement to the audience, and reminding us of the part
played by the Vidūṣaka in the drama. The Yādavas then supped, and this enjoyment was
followed by further songs and dances by the Apsarases, whose performance thus resembled
a modern ballet with songs interspersed.<a class="noteRef" id="n48.1src" href="#n48.1">52</a>
</p>
<p>In a later passage<a class="noteRef" id="n48.2src" href="#n48.2">53</a> in connexion with the story of the demon Vajranābha, whom Indra asked Kṛṣṇa to dispose
of, we learn of an actor Bhadra who delighted all by his excellent power of representation;
Vajranābha is induced to demand his presence in his abode, and Kṛṣṇa’s son Pradyumna
and his friends disguise themselves to penetrate there; Pradyumna is to be the hero,
Sāmba the Vidūṣaka, and Gada the assistant of the stage director, while maidens, skilled
in song, dance, and music, are the actresses; they delight the demons by presenting
the story of Viṣṇu’s descent on earth to slay the chief of the Rākṣasas, a dramatised
version of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, presenting the figures of Rāma, his brother, and in special the episode of Ṛṣyaçṛn̄ga
and Çāntā, that curious old legend based on a fertility- and rain-ritual.<a class="noteRef" id="n48.3src" href="#n48.3">54</a> After the play the actors showed their skill in depicting <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>situations suggested by their hosts, and Vajranābha himself induces them to perform
an episode from the legend of Kubera, the rendezvous of Rambhā; after music from the
orchestra the actresses sing, Pradyumna enters and recites the benediction, and then
a verse on the descent of the Ganges, which is connected with the subject-matter of
the piece; he then assumes the <span class="corr" id="xd32e2420" title="Source: role">rôle</span> of Nalakūbara, Sāmba is his Vidūṣaka, Çūra plays Rāvaṇa, Manovatī Rambhā. Nalakūbara
curses Rāvaṇa, and consoles Rambhā, and the audience was delighted by the skilled
acting of the Yādavas, who by a magic illusion had presented mount Kailāsa on the
stage.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>Theories of the Secular Origin of the Drama</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Professors Hillebrandt<a class="noteRef" id="n49.1src" href="#n49.1">55</a> and Konow<a class="noteRef" id="n49.2src" href="#n49.2">56</a> agree in the main in maintaining the view that it is an error to look to religious
ceremonies as explaining the origin of the drama. True, these ceremonies have a share
in the development of the drama, but they themselves are merely the introduction into
the ritual of elements which have a popular origin. We are to believe that a popular
mime existed, which, with the epic, lies at the bottom of the Sanskrit drama.
</p>
<p>It must be admitted at once that we have extremely little authentic information regarding
the performers of these mimes, believed to have existed before the origin of drama.
The statements made by Professor Konow, who finds in them experts in song, dance,
music, but also in matters such as jugglery, pantomime, and the allied arts, all rest
on evidence which is either contemporary with the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> or later than it; the fact that Naṭas sang is recorded for us in the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, which of course may refer to genuine actors, and not to professors of the mime,
and their connexion with sweet words is attested in the Jātaka prose only, which dates
several centuries after the existence of the true drama. We need not, of course, doubt
that music, song, and dance, popular in the Vedic age, preserved that character throughout
the later period, and we have evidence from Açoka’s time onwards of the existence
of Samājas which he condemned, doubtless because of the fights of animals which took
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>place at them.<a class="noteRef" id="n50.1src" href="#n50.1">57</a> That Naṭas and Nartakas were present at such festivals we learn from the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>; but we cannot say whether pantomimes and dancers or actors and dancers are referred
to. Our knowledge, in fact, of the primitive mime is hypothetical, and it rests in
effect on certain considerations which Professor Hillebrandt adduces to show a popular
as opposed to a religious origin for drama. His view is supported by the general argument
that the drama as comedy is a natural expression of man’s primitive life of pleasure
and appreciation of humour and wit. It is, however, unnecessary to enter into any
examination of this general principle, which he defends against the theory accepted
by Dr. Gray that it is highly problematical whether any view of pleasure to the actors
or audience is associated with primitive drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n50.2src" href="#n50.2">58</a> These ultimate origins are a matter of indifference to the concrete question of the
origin of so late a production as the classical drama of India. That the mimetic character
is natural to man may be granted; the essential point in question is whether the Sanskrit
drama in its characteristics shows signs of religious or secular origin.
</p>
<p>Of the points adduced by Professor Hillebrandt most have clearly no relevance in the
argument. The use of Sanskrit and dialects in the classical drama is claimed as a
proof of popular origin; as has been explained above, the Prākrit element is due to
the fact that the drama contains an essential popular, but also religious, element,
the Kṛṣṇa worship. The mixture of prose and song, and the union of both with music
and the dance, are as natural on the theory of religious origin as on that of secular
derivation. The simplicity of the Indian stage, which knows no arrangements for providing
changes of scenery, is certainly no proof of secular origin; the Vedic religion is
singularly sparing in any external apparatus, and there is the strongest similarity
between its practice to mark out altars for its great sacrifices at pleasure, and
to have no regular sacrificial buildings, and the tradition throughout the Sanskrit
dramas which neither requires nor needs fixed theatres.
</p>
<p>The popular origin of the Vidūṣaka is obvious, but the point is whether this origin
is religious or secular, and we have seen <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>that the Vedic literature offers us in the Brahmin of the Mahāvrata the prototype,
possibly with reminiscences of the Çūdra in the Soma sale, of this figure, a fact
admitted by the supporters of the theory of secular origin. It is manifestly unnecessary
and illegitimate, when the descent of this figure from the Vedic literature is clear,
to insist that it was borrowed directly from popular usage, for which there is no
proof, but only conjecture.
</p>
<p>There remains the argument derived from the fact that the classical drama usually
begins with a dialogue between the Sūtradhāra and the Naṭī, who is usually represented
as his wife; in this we have, it is said, a reflex of the old popular mime. But an
examination of the practice and theory, as found in Bhāsa and the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, shows that we have no simple or naïve arrangement, but a very elaborate literary
device by which the actors bridge over the transition from the preliminaries of the
drama to the drama itself. The preliminaries are essentially popular religion, and
the detail was left largely in the hands of the Sūtradhāra and his assistants, aided
by a chorus of dancers and by musicians; they are doubtless older than the drama,
and it was an ingenious and happy device which was invented to carry on the preliminaries,
so that the transition to the drama was effective and satisfactory. It is, however,
a perversion of all probability to find in this item the trace of a primitive popular
secular performance.
</p>
<p>The evidence, therefore, for a secular origin disappears; it is curious, indeed, that
Professor Hillebrandt<a class="noteRef" id="n51.1src" href="#n51.1">59</a> himself adduces proof that the western parallel of the Vidūṣaka is connected with
religious ceremonies rather than a secular creation. But what is most remarkable of
all is that Professor Konow adduces as evidence of the secular origin of the drama
the Yātrās, which are essentially bound up with the religion of Kṛṣṇa, and the rough
dramatic sketches performed at Almora at the Holi festival, also <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>essentially religious.<a class="noteRef" id="n52.1src" href="#n52.1">60</a> It is indeed to ignore how essentially religion enters into the life of the Hindu
to imagine that it is possible to trace the beginnings of drama to a detached love
of amusement. It is apparently difficult for the modern mind to appreciate that religion
may cover matters which to us appear scarcely connected with it or even repugnant;
but this is a delusion largely due to the narrower and more exalted conception of
religion of the northern and western lands of Europe.
</p>
<p>Less plausible still is the attempt of Pischel<a class="noteRef" id="n52.2src" href="#n52.2">61</a> to find evidence that the puppet-play is the source of the Sanskrit drama, and that
moreover it has its home in India, whence it has spread over the world. The curious
and odd art may indeed have an Indian origin, but it would be wholly unwise to suppose
that the drama is due to it, nor is the theory apparently accepted on any side at
the present time. The existence of such a play is attested by the <i>Mahābhārata</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n52.3src" href="#n52.3">62</a> though the antiquity of the device is not thus made clear; in the <i>Kathāsaritsāgara</i>, following perhaps the <i>Bṛhatkathā</i> of Guṇāḍhya, possibly of the third century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, we hear of a damsel, daughter of the wonderful craftsman Asura Maya, who amused
her companion with puppets which could speak, dance, fly, fetch water, or pluck and
bring a garland. In the <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> of Rājaçekhara Rāvaṇa is represented as deceived by a puppet made to resemble Sītā,
in whose mouth a parrot was placed to give his entreaties suitable replies. Shaṅkar
Pāṇḍuraṅg Paṇḍit<a class="noteRef" id="n52.4src" href="#n52.4">63</a> records of his time that in the Marāṭha and Kanarese country there are travelling
marionette theatres, the only form of drama known in the villages; the puppets made
of wood or paper are managed by the director, whose style is Sūtradhāra; they can
stand or lie, dance or fight. From this puppet-play, it was suggested, the names of
the Sūtradhāra, as the puller of the strings, and of the Sthāpaka, arranger, his assistant,
passed over to the legitimate drama. The Vidūṣaka, in Pischel’s view, owed also his
origin to the puppet-play.
</p>
<p>Professor Hillebrandt<a class="noteRef" id="n52.5src" href="#n52.5">64</a> has argued against this theory on the ground that the puppet-play assumes the pre-existence
of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>drama, on which it must essentially be based, and he then uses the early date of the
puppet-play as a proof of the still earlier existence of the drama. The latter argument,
however, is unsatisfactory on various grounds. Apart from the fact that we cannot
date the epic references or prove them earlier than the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, we have the doubt whether such a contention can possibly be justified. The use of
puppets is primarily, of course, derived from the make-belief of children in playing
with dolls; the terms for puppets which denote ‘little daughter’ (<i lang="und">putrikā</i>, <i lang="und">puttalī</i>, <i lang="und">puttalikā</i>, <i lang="und">duhitṛkā</i>), show this clearly enough, and the popularity of puppets is indicated by the erotic
game known as the imitation of puppets, where the word for puppet (<i lang="und">pāñcālī</i>) suggests that the home of the puppet-play in India was the Pañcāla country. The
growth of the drama doubtless brought with it the use of puppets to imitate it in
brief, and from the drama came the Vidūṣaka, and not <i>vice versa</i>.
</p>
<p>Though Pischel’s theory<a class="noteRef" id="n53.1src" href="#n53.1">65</a> of the puppet-play as the origin of drama has failed to find supporters, the shadow
play, on whose importance in India he was the first to lay stress, has emerged in
lieu in the hands of Professor Lüders<a class="noteRef" id="n53.2src" href="#n53.2">66</a> as an essential element in the development of the Sanskrit drama, a position accepted
by Professor Konow. The place found for the drama is in connexion with the displays
of the Çaubhikas of the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>. Owing to the misinterpretation of that passage it is held that the Çaubhikas were
persons who explained matters to the audience to supplement either dumb actors<a class="noteRef" id="n53.3src" href="#n53.3">67</a> or shadow figures. It is admitted by Professor Lüders that there is no proof which
of these two eventualities is correct, but he endeavours both to prove the existence
of the shadow-play in early India and to show that the Çaubhikas had the function
of showing them. Based on this misinterpretation of the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> and on the hypotheses—wholly in the air—which it necessitates, is his view that the
influence of the epic on the drama was conveyed through <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>the use of shadow-figures to illustrate the epic recitation; this, united with the
art of the old Naṭas, gave birth to drama, though he is not certain whether such a
real drama existed or not at the time of Patañjali, and Konow sets its appearance
much later.
</p>
<p>The early evidence adduced for the existence of the shadow-drama is wholly unreliable.
Professor Konow suggests that the term Rūpa used in the fourth Rock Edict of Açoka,
where he speaks of exhibiting spectacles of the dwellings of the gods, of elephants
and bonfires, refers to a shadow device, in apparent ignorance of the true sense abundantly
illustrated by the attested facts as to the mode of such representations in Buddhist
literature;<a class="noteRef" id="n54.1src" href="#n54.1">68</a> he accepts the wholly absurd view that Rūpaka as a name of the drama is derived from
such shadow projections, while in fact it obviously denotes the visible presentation,
the normal and early sense of Rūpa. Equally unfortunate is the effort to discover
that the Sītābengā cave<a class="noteRef" id="n54.2src" href="#n54.2">69</a> shows signs of grooves in front, which might have served in connexion with the curtain
necessary for a shadow play, and much more so is the effort to explain Nepathya, the
name of the tiring-room behind the curtain in the Sanskrit drama, from a misunderstood
Prākrit <i lang="und">nevaccha</i>, which in its turn might represent a Sanskrit <i lang="und">naipāṭhya</i>—never found—denoting the place for the reader; apparently the shadows are in this
view explained by some person behind the curtain. The philological combination is
quite impossible.
</p>
<p>Pischel’s evidence for the early existence of the shadow-drama is all of it without
value. The term <i lang="und">rupparūpakam</i> occurs in v. 394 of the comparatively old <i>Therīgāthā</i> of the Buddhist Canon, but it may indicate a puppet-play, and this is rendered very
probable by the mention of a puppet only just before in the text; if not, it doubtless
means, as taken by the commentator, a piece of jugglery, an art always loved in India;
unfortunately the age of the text is uncertain, so that even for the puppet-play it
gives no precise date. It is certain that <i lang="und">rūpadakkha</i>, a term used in the <i>Milindapañha</i><a class="noteRef" id="n54.3src" href="#n54.3">70</a>—a work of dubious date—has no such reference, nor <i lang="und">lūpadakha</i> in a cave at Jogīmārā. To find <i lang="und">rūpopajīvana</i> in the <i>Mahābhārata</i> used in the sense of shadow-play <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>is impossible; the explanation is given by Nīlakaṇṭha,<a class="noteRef" id="n55.1src" href="#n55.1">71</a> and proves the existence in his time, the seventeenth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, of the custom, but the term is used in close proximity with appearing on the stage
(<i lang="und">ran̄gāvataraṇa</i>), and there is conclusive evidence that the word refers to the deplorable immorality
of the players, who actually have as a synonym in the lexicons the style of ‘living
by (the dishonour of) their wives (<i lang="und">jāyājīva</i>)’. The same fact explains the term <i lang="und">rūpopajīvin</i> used by Varāhamihira in the sixth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> in proximity to painters, writers, and singers: the actor is essentially mercenary.<a class="noteRef" id="n55.2src" href="#n55.2">72</a> It is impossible to accept the suggestion that the Aindrajālikas, who appear working
magic results in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, the <i>Prabodhacandrodaya</i>, and the Pūrvapīṭhikā of the <i>Daçakumāracarita</i>, were really shadow-dramatists; Indian magicians are well known even at present,
and the illusions which to some extent they produce have nothing whatever to do with
shadow-plays. The scenes which the magician describes to the king in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> were doubtless left to the imagination of the audience, just as was the apparent
fire which burned the inner apartments and enveloped the princess. To believe in realism
in these cases runs contrary to the stage directions of the play itself. From the
name Çaubhika, with its Prākrit equivalent Sobhiya, nothing whatever can be made out;
the word has no relation to shadows and is never explained by any authority in that
sense.
</p>
<p>We are left, therefore, with the evidence to be derived from the term Chāyānāṭaka,
which is interpreted by Pischel as a ‘shadow-drama’, and is applied to several dramas,
among which the oldest which can be dated with sufficient certainty is the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i> of Subhaṭa in the thirteenth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> The exact meaning of the term is uncertain, as it might denote a ‘drama in the state
of a shadow’, and this would accord perfectly with the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i> itself. That such a drama was a shadow-drama is best supported by the <i>Dharmābhyudaya</i> of Meghaprabhācārya,<a class="noteRef" id="n55.3src" href="#n55.3">73</a> which is styled a Chāyānāṭyaprabandha, and in which a definite stage direction is
found directing that, when the king expresses his intention to become an ascetic,
a puppet is to be placed inside the curtain in the attire of an ascetic. But the <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>date of this play is uncertain, and it is extremely difficult to argue with any certainty
from it to the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i>; why, it is inevitable to ask, should the latter play contain no stage direction
of this kind? We know that the shadow-drama arose in some part of India, for Nīlakaṇṭha
recognizes it, but we have no evidence that it existed at the time of the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i>.
</p>
<p>Whatever judgement be passed on this view,<a class="noteRef" id="n56.1src" href="#n56.1">74</a> and the matter must be left undecided in the absence of any effective evidence, it
is wholly impossible to accept the argument of Professor Lüders which would take the
<i>Dūtān̄gada</i> as the type of Chāyānāṭaka, and thence deduce that the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i> and the <i>Haridūta</i> are shadow-dramas. The one <i>Chāyānāṭya</i> which we know to have been a shadow-drama in fact is an ordinary play without kinship
to the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i>, and the same remark applies to the other dramas known to us which are styled Chāyānāṭakas.
There are, however, points of similarity between the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i> and the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i>; the prevalence of verse, often epic in character, over prose, the absence of Prākrit,
the large number of characters, and the omission of the Vidūṣaka, which explain themselves
easily in the latter case by the assumption that we have literary drama before us,
a play never intended to be acted. The conviction is strengthened by the shameless
plagiarisms of the plays from earlier Rāma dramas. In any case, however, we are dealing
with the late developments of the Sanskrit drama, and it is clear that nothing can
be gained from any assumption of a part played by the shadow-play in the evolution
of the Sanskrit drama. Even on Professor Lüders’s own interpretation of the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, all that is requisite is dumb players, and this form of drama is attested for India
in modern times.
</p>
<p>That the Sūtradhāra and Sthāpaka derive their names from manipulating the puppets
for either the puppet- or the shadow-drama is a suggestion which, though recently
repeated by Dr. Hultzsch, cannot be regarded as plausible.<a class="noteRef" id="n56.2src" href="#n56.2">75</a> The term Sthāpaka is colourless, and may merely denote ‘performer’; if it comes from
the puppet-play, it is difficult to see why such a person was needed beside the Sūtradhāra,
who moved the strings. Moreover, the theory recognizes the Sūtradhāra clearly <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>as the man who lays out the temporary playhouse needed for the exhibition, and this
sense passes easily over into that of director; this derivation is preferable on the
whole to the other, accepted by Professor Hillebrandt,<a class="noteRef" id="n57.1src" href="#n57.1">76</a> which would make him the man who knows the rules of his art.
</p>
<p>The shadow-play, we have seen, cannot have influenced the progress of the early drama,
and we may, therefore, leave aside the question whether it does not essentially presuppose
the drama, as Professor Hillebrandt contends; the parallel from Java adduced to refute
this opinion is clearly wholly inadequate, unless and until it can be proved that
the shadow play sprang up in Java without any previous knowledge of real drama.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> <i>Greek Influence on the Sanskrit Drama</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is undoubtedly a matter far from easy for any people to create from materials such
as existed in India a true drama, and it was a perfectly legitimate suggestion of
Weber’s<a class="noteRef" id="n57.2src" href="#n57.2">77</a> that the necessary impetus to creation may have been given by the contact of Greece
with India, through the representation of Greek plays at the courts of the kings in
Baktria, the Punjab, and Gujarāt, who brought with them Greek culture as well as Greek
forces. This view suffered modification in view of further consideration of the evidence
of an Indian drama in the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, and the final opinion of Weber was content with the view that a certain influence
might have been exerted by the Greek on the Sanskrit drama. The vehement repudiation
of this opinion by Pischel<a class="noteRef" id="n57.3src" href="#n57.3">78</a> was followed by the elaborate effort of Windisch<a class="noteRef" id="n57.4src" href="#n57.4">79</a> to trace the extent of the influence which he believed he could establish. Windisch’s
attitude is of special importance because he recognizes fully the elements which made
for the development of an independent Indian drama, the epic recitations and the mimetic
art of the Naṭa, whose name indicated, as a Prākritism of the root <i lang="und">nṛt</i>, dance, that he was at first a dancer, in the Indian sense of the term, that is one
who represents by <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>his postures and gestures emotions of varied kinds, or, in the terminology of the
Greek and Roman stage, a pantomime. But he insists on the distinction between the
dramatization of the epic material suggested by the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, and the features of the classical form of the drama. The subject-matter differs,
heroic and mythic figures are presented in the relations of everyday life, the chief
theme is a comedy of love, the plot is artistically developed and the action divided
into scenes, character types are developed, the epic element recedes before the development
of dialogue, verse is mingled with prose, Sanskrit with Prākrit. The change is remarkable;
was it aided by the influence of the Greek drama? Admittedly on any theory we must
allow for powerful causes to produce so splendid a development, and it would be idle
to ignore the possibility of such influence.
</p>
<p>Since Windisch wrote, the extent of Greek influence on India before and after the
Christian era has been the subject of much investigation, which has yielded its richest
fruits in the sphere of art. That India borrowed the incitement to the art of Gandhāra
from Greece as its ultimate source is undeniable, and it is equally clear that the
Buddhist adoption of the practice of depicting the human form of the Buddha, in lieu
of merely indicating his presence by some symbol such as his seat, was due to Greek
artistic influences. The extent to which the rise of the Mahāyāna school of Buddhism
was furthered by the influx of religious and philosophical ideas from the west is
still uncertain; but it is noteworthy that Professor Lévi,<a class="noteRef" id="n58.1src" href="#n58.1">80</a> who most strongly opposed the theory of Windisch, has himself attributed to western
influences the development of the new spirit in Buddhism which he traces in Açvaghoṣa,
whom he places in the entourage of Kaniṣka, dating the former in the first century
<span class="asc">B.C.</span> If this were the case, there would be decided difficulties in maintaining any chronological
objections such as Professor Lévi<a class="noteRef" id="n58.2src" href="#n58.2">81</a> originally urged to the theory of Windisch; when he attacked that theory he could
place the earliest Sanskrit dramas preserved, those of Kālidāsa in his view, five
or six centuries <span class="asc">A.D.</span> But now we have dramas of about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 100 which are certainly not the earliest of their <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>type, and it is impossible to deny that the Sanskrit drama came into being during
the period when Greek influence was present in India. The highest point of that influence
politically was doubtless attained under Menander; in the middle of the first century
<span class="asc">B.C.</span>, roughly a century after Menander’s conquests, the Greek princes were on the verge
of being absorbed by new influences culminating in the establishment of the Kuṣana<a class="noteRef" id="n59.1src" href="#n59.1">82</a> domination, but there is nothing chronologically difficult in assuming the influence
of Greek drama on the drama in India.
</p>
<p>The question, however, arises how far there was actual presentation at the courts
of Greek princes in India of dramatic entertainments. On this topic the evidence is
no doubt scanty.<a class="noteRef" id="n59.2src" href="#n59.2">83</a> We know indeed that Alexander was fond of theatrical spectacles with which he amused
himself in the intervals allowed by his victories, and we hear that at Ekbatana there
were no fewer than three thousand Greek artists who had come from Greece. We are told
also that the children of the Persians, the Gedrosians and the people of Susa, sang
the dramas of Euripides and Sophokles; if we are to believe Philostratos’s Life of
Apollonios of Tyana,<a class="noteRef" id="n59.3src" href="#n59.3">84</a> a Brahmin boasted that he had read the <i>Herakleidai</i> of Euripides, and Plutarch has described in inimitable fashion the strange scene
at the court of Orodes of Parthia when the messenger arrived, bearing the head of
Crassus, and the actor Iason substituted the ghastly relic for the head of Pentheus
in the <i>Bakchai</i>, which he was then performing. We need not doubt from these and other passages the
existence of performances of Greek dramas throughout the provinces which formed the
Empire of Alexander; the scepticism of Professor Lévi<a class="noteRef" id="n59.4src" href="#n59.4">85</a> in this regard is clearly inadmissible. It is perfectly true that of dramatic performances
in India we have no express mention, but in view of the miserably scanty information
we possess regarding these principalities of the Greeks in India there is nothing
surprising in the fact. Nor is it likely that princes who could employ artists of
sufficient ability to produce <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>beautiful coins would be indifferent to what is after all the greatest literary creation
of Greece.
</p>
<p>Nor can we lay much stress on the difficulty of India borrowing anything from the
Greek drama, owing to the great difference between the two civilizations, Indian exclusiveness,
Indian ignorance of foreign languages, or similar general considerations, because
we have really no evidence of value of the feelings and actions of the Indians during
the period when the Greek invasion was only the forerunner of invasions by Parthians,
Çakas, and Kuṣanas, followed by other less famous but not unimportant immigrants,
whose advent vitally affected the population and civilization of the north-west of
India. It is plain that in the Gupta dynasty of the fourth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> we find a great Hindu revival, but a revival which evidently drew strength primarily
from the east, and we do not know anything definite to enable us to reason <i lang="la">a priori</i> on what was, or was not, possible as regards assimilation of the drama. The only
decisive evidence possible is that of the actual plays, and unfortunately the results
to be attained by examination of them are not at all satisfactory.
</p>
<p>It is held by Windisch that the New Attic Comedy, which flourished from 340–260 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, must be deemed the source of influence on Indian drama; the fact that no mention
of this comedy is specifically made in the few notices we have of drama in the east
is doubtless not of importance. On the other hand, we know that Alexandria under the
Lagidai became a great centre of Greek learning, and that between Alexandria and Ujjayinī
through the port of Barygaza<a class="noteRef" id="n60.1src" href="#n60.1">86</a> there was a brisk exchange of trade which may have aided in intellectual contact,<a class="noteRef" id="n60.2src" href="#n60.2">87</a> perhaps especially in the period when Menander’s conquests gave Greek products of
every sort a special vogue. The new comedy by its making its subject of the everyday
life of man was far more suited than any other form of drama to attract imitation.
</p>
<p>The actual points of contact between the New Comedy and the Sanskrit drama are, however,
scanty. The division of both the Roman drama<a class="noteRef" id="n60.3src" href="#n60.3">88</a> and the Sanskrit into acts, distinguished by <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>the departure of all the actors from the stage and the number of five as normal, though
often exceeded in India, are facts which need not be more than casual coincidences:
the divisions in the Sanskrit drama rest on an analysis of the action which is not
recorded in Greece or Rome. There is similarity in the scenic conventions, in the
asides, in the entry and exit of characters, more notably in the practice that the
advent of a new character is usually expressly notified to the audience by a remark
from one of the actors already on the stage. But these are all matters which must
almost inevitably coincide in theatrical performances produced under approximately
similar conditions. Even in the modern theatre with its programmes the necessity of
indicating at once the identity of the new comers to the stage is keenly felt.
</p>
<p>More value attaches to the argument from the use of Yavanikā,<a class="noteRef" id="n61.1src" href="#n61.1">89</a> or its Prākrit form Javanikā, for the name of the curtain which covered the tiring
room and formed the background of the stage. The word primarily is an adjective meaning
Ionian, the Greeks with whom India first came into contact. But it was not confined
to what was Greek in the strict sense of the word; it applies to anything connected
with the Hellenized Persian Empire, Egypt, Syria, Bactria, and it therefore cannot
be rigidly limited to what is Greek. As applied to the curtain it is an adjective,
and describes doubtless the material of the curtain (<i lang="und">paṭī</i>, <i lang="und">apaṭī</i>) as foreign, possibly as Lévi suggests, Persian tapestry brought to India by Greek
ships and merchants. The word Yavanikā has no special application to the curtain of
the theatre, as would be the case, if it were borrowed as a detail of stage arrangement
from Greece. Nor in fact was there any curtain in the case of Greek drama, so far
as is known, from which it could be borrowed; Windisch’s contention merely was that
the curtain was called Greek because it took the place of the painted scenery at the
back of the Greek stage.
</p>
<p>As little can any conclusion of Greek borrowing be drawn from the Yavanīs, Greek maidens,
who are represented as among the body-guard of the king;<a class="noteRef" id="n61.2src" href="#n61.2">90</a> for this the Greek drama offers no <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>parallel; it represents the fondness of the princes of India<a class="noteRef" id="n62.1src" href="#n62.1">91</a> for the fascinating hetaerae of Greece, and the readiness of Greek traders to make
the high profits to be derived from shipping these youthful cargoes.
</p>
<p>The points of resemblance in regard to the plot are of interest. There is some similarity
between the stock theme of the Nāṭikā, the love of a king for a maiden, hindered by
various obstacles, and finally successful through events which reveal her as a princess,
destined for him in marriage but concealed in this aspect by some accident, and the
New Comedy picture of the youth whose affection for a fair lady, apparently of status
which forbids marriage by Attic law, but in reality of equal birth, is finally rewarded
by the discovery of the mark which leads to her identification. The use of a mark
of recognition is undoubtedly common in both dramas. We have in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> the ring<a class="noteRef" id="n62.2src" href="#n62.2">92</a> which gives part of the title of the play <i>Abhijñāna-Çakuntalā</i>, and in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> the stone of reunion (<i lang="und">saṁgamamaṇi</i>) which enables Purūravas to recognise his beloved despite her change into a creeper.
In the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> we have the necklace which <span class="corr" id="xd32e2895" title="Source: permitsthe">permits the</span> identification of the heroine; in the <i>Nāgānanda</i>, the jewel which, falling from the sky, denotes the fate of the prince; in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> the garland plucked by Mādhava, worn by Mālatī, which Saudāminī produces at the dénouement
as a sign of recognition; and in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> the clay cart in which are placed the jewels used as evidence against the hero. In
the same general category fall the ring of the queen in the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>, which the Vidūṣaka obtains from her in order to cure a snake-bite, and employs to
bring about the release of Mālavikā; the arrow of Āyus, in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, which reveals to Purūravas his son; and the seal of Rākṣasa in the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i> of which Cāṇakya makes use to confound his schemes. In <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>some cases the similarity of use of these emblems is close; Mālavikā, taken away by
brigands, and Ratnāvalī, rescued from the sea, are real parallels to the heroine of
the <i>Rudens</i>, stolen from her father by a brigand, sold to a <i>leno</i> and wrecked on the Sicilian coast, whose recognition is brought about by the discovery
of her childish ornaments.
</p>
<p>These are striking facts, and the only way to meet them is to show that the motifs
in Sanskrit drama have an earlier history in the literature, and can, therefore, be
regarded as natural developments. The difficulty presented here is that the literature
available consists either of tales, which in any form available to us are later than
the period of the supposed Greek influence, or the epic which is of uncertain date,
so that no strict proof is available that any of its minor issues antedates the Christian
era. But we do find in the epic indications that it was not necessary for Greece to
give to India the ideas presented in the drama. The story of the love of Kīcaka for
Draupadī, when disguised as handmaiden she served Sudeṣṇā, wife of the king Virāṭa,
has a tragic outcome, for his love is repulsed, but it has undoubted affinities with
the plot of the Nāṭikā. In the case of the old tale of Nala and Damayantī, the heroine
is more happy, for, when separated from her husband who has abandoned her in the distraction
of losing his kingdom at dice, she lives in peace, guarded securely from interference;
at last she is recognized by a birthmark. In the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> the use of signs of this sort is extended to artificial modes: Sītā, stolen away
from Rāma, drops her jewels to the ground; the monkeys bear them to their king, who
hands them to Rāma, and the hero thus knows beyond a peradventure the identity of
the ravisher. To console her in her detention pending his efforts at rescue he sends
Hanumant to her, bearing his messages, and gives him his ring to serve to identify
him; Sītā sees it and takes heart. We may admit that such incidents are almost inevitable
in a primitive society, in which the means of identification were necessarily material,
or personal. Nor in the Sanskrit drama is there any preponderant use of this factor;
the letter and the portrait<a class="noteRef" id="n63.1src" href="#n63.1">93</a> are other means, the use of which is recognized in the theory.
</p>
<p>The evidence of borrowing based on the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> by <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>Windisch requires reconsideration in the light of the facts now known regarding the
authority of that drama for the early Sanskrit drama. To Windisch it seemed to present
every appearance of an early age, and to show close relations to a Greek model. The
title he compared with the <i>Cistellaria</i>, ‘little chest’, or the <i>Aulularia</i>, ‘little pot’; the mixture of a political intrigue and a love drama with the mention—only
incidental however—of political events contemporaneous with the action in Plautus’s
<i>Epidicus</i> and <i>Captivi</i>; the court scene he held to be of Greek inspiration; the meeting of Cārudatta and
Vasantasenā he compared with that of the hero and heroine of the <i>Cistellaria</i>; the theft of Çarvilaka, in order to buy the freedom of the slave girl he loves,
to the dishonest means adopted by the hero in the new comedy to procure means to purchase
his inamorata; the setting free of the slave by Vasantasenā with the attaining of
the position of a freedwoman in the Greek drama; finally the elevation of Vasantasenā
to the rank of a woman of good character to permit of her legal marriage to Cārudatta
is compared with the discovery in the Greek drama of the existence of a free status
as the birthright of the maiden whom the hero loves. The <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, however, is not an early representative of the Indian drama in the sense held by
Windisch; it is based on the <i>Cārudatta</i> of Bhāsa, in which there is no mingling of the political and love intrigue, at any
rate as we have that play; the title <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, which departs from the usual model, was probably deliberately chosen to distinguish
the new drama from the old. The plays cited have no real combination of political
and love intrigues, and the other parallels are far too vague to be taken seriously.
The raising of Vasantasenā to a new status is an extraordinary event, which is dependent
on an action of the new king Āryaka, who, as an overthrower of the former monarch,
exercises the supreme right of sovereignty in favour of the lady, in defiance of the
rules of caste. The political intrigue thus becomes a vital element in the play.
</p>
<p>Nor can any special value be ascribed to the rule, which is laid down in the theory,
and observed in practice, and which confines the events in an act to the limits of
a single day, as compared with the rule of Aristotle<a class="noteRef" id="n64.1src" href="#n64.1">94</a> that the events of a drama should not <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>exceed, or only by a little, the duration of a day. If the rule was borrowed, it was
greatly changed in sense by permitting long periods, up to a year, to elapse between
the acts in the Sanskrit drama, and the mere moral needs of the approximation to reality
requisite for illusion would produce the state of the Sanskrit drama without external
influence.
</p>
<p>The characters of the drama present problems which are not solved by the theory of
borrowing. The figure of the queen, loving her husband, noble and dignified, is compared
by Windisch with that of the <i>matrona</i> of the Roman comedy, while her attempts to prevent the union of her husband and the
new love are compared to the efforts of the <i>senex</i> to dissuade his son from a rash marriage or intrigue. But it is clear that the comparisons
are idle; the rivalry of the old love and the new is an incident of the life of the
harem inevitable in polygamy, while it affords an admirable opportunity for the poet
to depict the contrast of types and the different aspects of love, his chief theme.
Windisch, however, lays most stress on his comparison of the three figures of the
Viṭa, Vidūṣaka, and Çakāra, with the parasite, the <i lang="la">servus currens</i>, and the <i lang="la">miles gloriosus</i> of the Greek drama, and his arguments have a certain weight. It is true that these
three, with the Sūtradhāra and his assistant, are given by the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> in a list of actors, and that the five correspond fairly closely with the male personnel
of a Greek drama; it is also true that, while Kālidāsa and the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> with the <i>Cārudatta</i> know the Çakāra, he vanishes from the later drama, and the Viṭa shows comparatively
little life, suggesting that the Greek borrowings were gradually felt unsuited to
India and died a natural death. But the argument is inadequate to prove borrowing.
The Viṭa is, indeed, more closely akin to the parasite than to any other character
of the Greek or Roman comedy, but the parasite is lacking in the refinement and culture
of his Indian counterpart, who is clearly drawn from life, the witty and accomplished
companion who is paid to amuse his patron, but whose dependence does not make him
the object of insolence and bad jokes. The Vidūṣaka has, in all likelihood, as has
been seen, his origin in the religious drama; his Brahmin caste, and his use of Prākrit
can best thus be explained. The alternative views all present far more difficulties;
the transformance of the slave into a Brahmin <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>is far too violent a change to be credible, while Lévi’s<a class="noteRef" id="n66.1src" href="#n66.1">95</a> view which makes him a borrowing from the Prākrit drama, which depicted with truth
the type of Brahmin who serves as go-between in love affairs, masking his degraded
trade under the cloak of religion, renders it unintelligible why the Brahmins should
have consented to maintain him in the Sanskrit drama. Equally unconvincing is Professor
Konow’s<a class="noteRef" id="n66.2src" href="#n66.2">96</a> effort to explain him as a figure of the popular drama, which loved to make fun of
the higher classes, especially the Brahmins. There was no conceivable reason why the
Brahmins should have kept such a figure in a drama which never appealed to the lower
classes, and it is significant that there is no trace of a comic figure of the Kṣatriya
class, although the populace doubtless was as willing to make fun of the rulers as
of the priests. The similarity between the Çakāra and the <i lang="la">miles gloriosus</i> is by no means small, but the argument from borrowing is refuted by the reflexion
that such a figure can be explained perfectly easily from the actual life of India
in the period of Bhāsa and the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, when mercenary soldiers must have been painfully familiar to Indians.
</p>
<p>The number of actors is certainly not in accord with the Greek practice; not only
has Bhāsa large numbers, but the <i>Çakuntalā</i> has thirty, the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> twenty-nine, the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> eighteen, the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i> twenty-four, and it is only in the later and less inventive Bhavabhūti that we find
but thirteen in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> and eleven in the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i>.
</p>
<p>The prologue in both dramas serves the purpose of announcing the author’s name, the
title of the play, and the desire of the dramatist for a sympathetic reception, but
the Indian prologue is closely attached to the preliminaries, and has a definite and
independent character of its own in the conversation between the Sūtradhāra and his
wife, the chief actress, so that borrowing is out of the question. Nor does any importance
attach to the fact that Çiva, who is in a special sense the patron of drama, is the
nearest Indian representative of Dionysos, or that the time of the festival at which
plays were often shown was spring, as in the case of the Great Dionysia at Athens
when new plays were usually presented. There is similarity between the Protagonist
and the Sūtradhāra, for both undertake the leading parts in the drama, <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>but this and other minor points such as can be adduced are of no value as proofs of
historical connexion.
</p>
<p>Windisch admitted that in regard to the theatrical buildings there was no possibility
of comparison, as the Indian theatre was not permanent, but Bloch<a class="noteRef" id="n67.1src" href="#n67.1">97</a> has endeavoured to show that the Sītābengā cave theatre has marked affinities to
the Greek. The attempt, however, is clearly a failure; the construction of the whole
is merely that of a small amphitheatre cut out in the rock for a small audience without
any special similarity to the Greek theatre of any period.
</p>
<p>More recently the tendency of those who seek to find Greek influence in the making
of the Sanskrit drama has turned to the mime as the form of art which exercised influence
on India, and the older arguments of Windisch have been given a new shape and in part
strengthened in this regard.<a class="noteRef" id="n67.2src" href="#n67.2">98</a> The mime was performed without masks and buskins, as was the Indian drama. Moreover
the mime, at any rate in Roman hands, had a curtain (<i lang="la">siparium</i>), which may be compared with the curtain of India. There was also no scene painting
in the mime; different dialects were used, and the number of actors was considerable.
Further, some of the standing types of the mime may be paralleled in the Indian drama;
the zēlotypos has some similarity to the Çakāra, the mōkos to the Vidūṣaka.
</p>
<p>Some of the arguments adduced against this theory of Reich’s are admittedly untenable.
It is impossible to argue as does Professor Konow that the use of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> as a work of early date is a mistake, since the oldest dramas preserved are of quite
another type and have no similarity with Greek works. True, the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> is not as old as it was thought, but the <i>Cārudatta</i> can be substituted in lieu, and there are no dramas older than it, save those of
the same author and some fragments of Buddhist drama. Nor have we any very satisfactory
evidence of a mime in India at an early date, for a mime means a great deal more than
the mere work of a Naṭa. But there are adequate grounds for disregarding the theory.
The similarity of types is not at all convincing; the borrowing of the idea of using
<span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>different dialects from the mime is really absurd, and the large number of actors
is equally natural in either case. The argument from the curtain is wholly without
probative power; as we have seen, the term Yavanikā refers to material only; it would
be very remarkable that the term Greek should be confined to the curtain alone, if
the stage were really a Greek borrowing, and, last not least, we have no proof that
the Greek mime had the curtain. The new form of the theory must, therefore, claim
no more credence than the old. We cannot assuredly deny<a class="noteRef" id="n68.1src" href="#n68.1">99</a> the possibility of Greek influence, in the sense that Weber admitted the probability;
the drama, or the mime, may, as played at Greek courts, have aided in the development
of a true drama, but the evidence leaves only a negative answer to the search for
positive signs of influence.
</p>
<p>There are, undoubtedly, certain considerations which <i lang="la">a priori</i> tell against borrowing; to judge from the Roman borrowings from Greece and those
of France from the classics, the trace of imitation if it were real would be clear
and emphatic. But we can hardly place very great faith in arguments from analogy;
India has a strange genius for converting what it borrows and assimilating it, as
it did in the case of the image of the Buddha which it fabricated from Greek models.
More important is the possibility of tracing the sources of the dramas in the epic
and the tales, though here the difficulty of dates prevents the demonstration being
complete. The epic and undramatic character of the Sanskrit drama is true enough,
but not universally applicable, and the argument is liable to be turned by adopting
the view that only Greek influence is contended for, not the exclusion of Indian native
influences. The typical nature of the characters, adduced by Professor Konow as a
point of difference, seems to indicate a forgetfulness that the Greek drama, and especially
the New Comedy, is rich in types, and that the mime depicts types. Nor in that comedy
do we find any particularly effective heightening of interest or development of the
situation from the characters of the persons, or solutions produced without recourse
to cutting the knot by artificial means. In all these matters indeed the Indian drama
rather is akin to the Greek than otherwise.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">6.</span> <i>The Çakas and the Sanskrit Drama</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Professor <span class="corr" id="xd32e3067" title="Source: Levi">Lévi</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="n69.1src" href="#n69.1">100</a> whose opposition to Windisch regarding the possibility of Greek influence on the
Indian drama has been noted, is himself responsible for the suggestion that the rise
of the Sanskrit drama, as opposed to the more popular religious drama in Prākrit,
is to be attributed to the Çakas, whose advent to India was one of the causes of the
rapid decadence of the Greek principalities in the <span class="corr" id="xd32e3081" title="Source: north west">north-west</span>. The theory is based on a general view of the elevation of Sanskrit to the rank of
the language of literature, as opposed to its restriction to use as the learned and
sacred language of the Brahmins. The inscriptions, on the whole, show that Sanskrit
as an epigraphic language was introduced by Rudradāman whose Girnār inscription of
<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 150 is wholly in Sanskrit, though Sanskrit appears in part in Uṣavadāta’s inscription
of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 124. The Western Kṣatrapas, of Çaka origin, were, he holds, the first to bring Sanskrit
down to earth, while not vulgarizing it, as contrasted with the Hindu and orthodox
Çātakarṇis of the Deccan who retained Prākrit in their inscriptions down to the third
century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> The character of the Çakāra may be regarded in this light; in its hostility to the
Çakas it reveals a period when either a prince was opposed to the Çaka rule, or the
Çaka dominion had just fallen and was fresh in the minds of the people. The <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> may retain a confused version of the events of the second century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> A specific connexion between the Çakas and the creation of drama may be seen in the
terminology of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, and that of their inscriptions. Rudradāman refers to his grandfather Caṣṭana as
Svāmin and Sugṛhītanāman, and Svāmin is freely used in the epigraphic records of the
kings of the line from Nahapāna (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 78) onwards. Further Rudrasena in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 205, in referring to his royal ancestors, Caṣṭana, Jayadāman, Rudradāman, and Rudrasena,
gives them the epithet of Bhadramukha, ‘of gracious countenance’. These terms, Lévi
argues, correspond with the use laid down in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, which must have borrowed from contemporary official usage. Further, Rudradāman uses
the term Rāṣṭriya as applying to Puṣyagupta, who under <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>Candragupta, the Maurya, some four and a half centuries earlier established the reservoir
which he had repaired, and this term occurs in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> and the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> in the sense of brother-in-law of the king, the sense given to it in the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e3117" title="Source: Amarakosa">Amarakoça</span></i>, the earliest Sanskrit lexicon of established authority. To these considerations
may be added that Ujjayinī, the capital of the Western Kṣatrapas of Mālava, is a centre,
round which as a fan radiate the three great literary Prākrits of the drama, Çaurasenī,
Māgadhī, and Māhārāṣṭrī, thus accounting for their use, which else would be difficult
to explain.
</p>
<p>Lévi’s suggestion, which was accompanied by an admission that the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> or its source was older than he had formerly argued, and that the possibility of
Greek influence was thus increased, has been accepted by Professor Konow<a class="noteRef" id="n70.1src" href="#n70.1">101</a> with the important modification that in face of the fact that the oldest dramas known
to us, the fragments of Açvaghoṣa and those of Bhāsa, ignore Māhārāṣṭrī and that Çaurasenī
is the normal prose tongue, he accepts Mathurā as the home of the drama, and ascribes
it to about the middle of the first century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> This view he supports by the fact that the rulers of Mathurā were also Çaka Kṣatrapas,
or Satraps, whose control extends back at least to the beginning of the first century
<span class="asc">A.D.</span>
</p>
<p>It may be feared that neither theory will stand critical investigation, however tempting
it may be to obtain an exact date for the Sanskrit drama. The discovery of Açvaghoṣa’s
fragments shows that the drama has already attained a very definite and complete form,
and we really cannot with any probability assume that the creation of drama preceded
this by no more than a century. Even a century, however, brings us further back than
the middle of the first century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, for Konow’s date of Kaniṣka, about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 150,<a class="noteRef" id="n70.2src" href="#n70.2">102</a> is probably considerably too late, and should be placed fifty years earlier at least.
We are thus separated from Rudradāman by a period of 150 years, probably more, and
the theory that the Western Kṣatrapas introduced Sanskrit into the drama falls hopelessly
to the ground on chronological considerations alone.
</p>
<p>The argument from the use of technical terms is clearly untenable. That Rāṣṭriya in
Rudradāman’s inscription has the sense <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>of ‘brother-in-law’ is not supported by the slightest evidence, and is most improbable;
the term doubtless denotes governor, and the restricted use is a later development.
The use of Svāmin as the mode of addressing the king is not recorded in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, and to argue that it, being given in the <i>Daçarūpa</i> and the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i>, must be borrowed from Bharata, as Konow does, is quite impossible. On the contrary,
Bharata<a class="noteRef" id="n71.1src" href="#n71.1">103</a> gives the style to the Yuvarāja, or Crown Prince, presumably as distinct from the
king. In the extant dramas after Bhāsa it is not used of the king or Crown Prince.
Sugṛhītanāman, denoting perhaps ‘whose name is uttered with respect’, has no parallel
in Bharata; only in the later theory do we find Sugṛhītābhidha, which, however, is
prescribed merely for the address of a pupil, child, or younger brother to a teacher,
father, or elder brother, and therefore stands in no conceivable relation to the term
used by Rudradāman. Bhadramukha is the address to a royal prince in Bharata; it is
used of kings by Rudrasena, and the literature ignores the specific or royal use.
The lack of accord is complete and convincing; if the drama had originated under the
Western Kṣatrapas of Ujjayinī, it would not have been so flagrantly out of harmony
with the official language.
</p>
<p>The whole error of these arguments rests in the belief that the drama developed as
a Prākrit drama before it was turned into Sanskrit. The same theory has been applied
to every department of secular Sanskrit literature without either plausibility or
success; the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> knows Sanskrit Kāvya before any Prākrit Kāvya is recorded.<a class="noteRef" id="n71.2src" href="#n71.2">104</a> But, apart from this, it is essential to remember that the drama was religious in
origin and essentially connected with epic recitations, and that for both reasons
Sanskrit claimed in it a rightful place from the inception. It is certain that the
recitations known by Patañjali were in Sanskrit, and it is difficult in the extreme
to understand how in the view of Lévi and Konow a Prākrit drama proper ever came into
being. Before the coalescence of the epic recitation and the primitive mime believed
in by Konow, there cannot have been any drama on his own theory; when they coalesced,
Sanskrit must have from the first been present.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>The discovery of Açvaghoṣa’s fragments undoubtedly helps greatly to bring the creation
of the drama very close up to the time of Patañjali, if not to that date. The first
century <span class="asc">B.C.</span> can with fair certainty be assumed to be the very latest period at which the appearance
of a genuine Sanskrit drama can be placed. If indeed Professor Lüders’s former date
for Kaniṣka were correct and he were the founder of the Vikrama era of 57 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="n72.1src" href="#n72.1">105</a> then the Sanskrit drama must be dated a century at least earlier, and we would have
the paradoxical position that on Professor Lüders’s date of Açvaghoṣa he must place
the drama at not later than Patañjali, while when dealing with the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> evidence he doubts the existence of the drama. Professor Lüders has overlooked this
dilemma, which, however, we may evade on his behalf by recognising that he erred in
assigning to Kaniṣka a date which the evidence available in 1911 already showed to
be quite untenable.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">7.</span> <i>The Evidence of the Prākrits</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The discovery of Açvaghoṣa’s fragments not only disposes effectively of Professor
Lévi’s dating of the rise of Sanskrit drama, since he probably preceded Rudradāman
by at least half a century, but it casts a vivid light on the question of the Prākrits
and Sanskrit. It must be remembered that Açvaghoṣa was the exponent of a faith which
had originally insisted on the use of the vernacular as opposed to Sanskrit, and that
it is absurd to imagine that it would have occurred to him to use Sanskrit in dramas
of Buddhist inspiration and aim, had not the use of that language been established
in the drama of the day. This leads us back once more to the conclusion that the drama
from the outset was written in part at least in Sanskrit, and that, therefore, it
stands in genetic relation with the dramatic recitations described by Patañjali which
were in Sanskrit.
</p>
<p>That the drama was also in part in Prākrit from the outset seems extremely probable.
The mere recitation of the epic <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>indeed did not demand any intervention of Prākrit, but that such recitations by themselves
would produce a true drama is most improbable, and we may legitimately hold that it
was only the union of these recitations with action from the religious contest that
produced the drama. In that contest we may assume that the lower classes were represented
and spoke their own language; in the Vedic Mahāvrata we cannot suppose that the Çūdra
who contested the right of the Vaiçya to the symbol of the sun spoke in Sanskrit,
nor that the Brahmin and the hetaera exchanged their ritual abuse in the classical
tongue, or its Vedic antecedent. The religious festival in which Kṛṣṇa appeared as
slaying Kaṅsa must similarly have demanded the use of the vernacular by the humbler
members of those who took part in it. The fact that Prākrit appears mainly in the
dialogue, Sanskrit pre-eminently in verses, strengthens the view that the new drama
derived its verse in the main from the epic recitation, its prose dialogue from the
religious contest. The two elements never entirely merged; the Vidūṣaka who comes
from one side of the religious ceremonial, that which in Greece lies at the basis
of comedy as opposed to tragedy, is not a figure normal in the dramas of mainly epic
inspiration; but this is not enough to prove that the drama ever in its early days
was merely in Sanskrit. It may indeed have been the case; Bhāsa’s <i>Dūtavākya</i> has no Prākrit, and so far the probability is rather for than against it, as an alternative
form.
</p>
<p>The question how many Prākrits were used in the primitive Sanskrit drama presents
difficulties. The obvious conclusion is that the vernacular employed would be that
of the region where the drama came into being, and that this was the Çūrasena country
is not to be denied. Çaurasenī in fact appears throughout as the normal prose of the
drama; it is the language of the Vidūṣaka and the hetaera and normally of all the
characters of a play who are born in Āryāvarta, and no other dialect even in theory
vies with it in importance. The theory and the practice after Bhāsa ascribe to Māhārāṣṭrī
the honour of the language of verses sung by maidens who would in prose speak Çaurasenī.
There can be no doubt that this is not primitive, but is a reflex of the growth and
development of the fame of the artificial lyric poetry of which we have an anthology
under the <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>name of Hāla, perhaps to be ascribed to the third or fifth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span><a class="noteRef" id="n74.1src" href="#n74.1">106</a>
</p>
<p>To what extent any other Prākrit was used in the earliest drama we cannot effectively
determine. Bhāsa has only, besides Çaurasenī, Māgadhī of two kinds, and a few hints
of what may be styled Ardha-Māgadhī, while Açvaghoṣa has three dialects which suggest
much older forms of Çaurasenī, Māgadhī, and Ardha-Māgadhī. The use of these dialects
for characters by Açvaghoṣa explains itself naturally from his familiarity with the
Buddhist scriptures whose original was very probably in something approximating to
the Ardha-Māgadhī<a class="noteRef" id="n74.2src" href="#n74.2">107</a> he knew, and the fact that the speaker of Old Māgadhī is the Duṣṭa, or bad man, reminds
us of the bad character enjoyed<a class="noteRef" id="n74.3src" href="#n74.3">108</a> by the Magadha. Lévi’s<a class="noteRef" id="n74.4src" href="#n74.4">109</a> suggestion that the Māgadhī of the drama comes from its epic element, and that the
Māgadhas were the reciters of Prākrit epic compositions, is clearly untenable, and
indeed seems to have been later abandoned by its author in favour of the suggestion
that the Prākrits of the drama were evolved, because the drama was produced at Ujjayinī,
which was a meeting place of different dialectical forms. This theory might be revised
to adapt it to making Mathurā the headquarters of the drama and Māgadhī and Ardha-Māgadhī
the other dialects, but the restricted use of anything but Çaurasenī by Bhāsa suggests
that the introduction of other Prākrits was a gradual process. In point of fact it
never attained great vitality, and in the developed drama Çaurasenī and Māhārāṣṭrī
alone play any real part. The ground for the more extended use of dialects when found
may be attributed to literary purposes rather than to any attempt to imitate the speech
of the day, as Sir George Grierson<a class="noteRef" id="n74.5src" href="#n74.5">110</a> has suggested. The ground for this conclusion, apart from the improbability of so
great an effort at realism, is that the dialects used for instance even in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> are clearly literary and not attempts to reproduce true vernaculars.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>The stage reached by the Prākrits of Açvaghoṣa shows clearly how late are the Prākrits
of the orthodox classical drama,<a class="noteRef" id="n75.1src" href="#n75.1">111</a> and reminds us how much more closely akin to Sanskrit must have been the Prākrit
of the drama of the time of, or shortly after, Patañjali. The classical drama with
its broken-down forms of Prākrit gives a false impression of the original dramatic
form in which either perhaps Sanskrit alone, if the matter were epic, or both Sanskrit
and a closely akin Çaurasenī appeared.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">8.</span> <i>The Literary Antecedents of the Drama</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The drama owes in part its origin to the epics of India; from them throughout its
history it derives largely its inspiration, far more truly so indeed than Greek tragedy
as compared with the Greek epic.<a class="noteRef" id="n75.2src" href="#n75.2">112</a> From the epics also developed the Kāvya, the refined and polished epic, which appears
at its best in the <i>Kumārasambhava</i> and <i>Raghuvaṅça</i> of Kālidāsa. The parallelism between the developed form of both is close and striking.
The <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n75.3src" href="#n75.3">113</a> lays down that it is a composition in several cantos, the hero a god or Kṣatriya
of high race, of the type noble and superior; if there are several heroes, they are
persons of royal rank of one family. The sentiment which predominates is the erotic,
the heroic, or occasionally that of calm; the others serve in a subsidiary rôle. The
subject-matter is either taken from tradition or not, but the heroes must be virtuous.
The work begins with a prayer, a benediction, or an indication of the subject-matter.
The development of the story employs the same five junctures as the theory prescribes
for the drama. One or other of the four aims of man, wealth, love, performance of
duty, or release, is to be attained by the action. The number of cantos is not to
be less than eight; each should end in a different metre, and should announce the
subject of the following act. Descriptions of every kind are essential; objects of
these are the different times of day, the sun, the moon, night, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>dawn, twilight, darkness, morning, midday, the hunt, mountains, the seasons, forests,
the ocean, the sky, a town, the pleasures of love, the misery of separation from one’s
beloved, a sacrifice, a battle, the march of an army, a marriage, the birth of a son,
all of which should be developed in appropriate detail.
</p>
<p>The essential feature of these little epics is the enormous development of the art
of description, and the feature occurs in the other forms of narrative literature,
the Kathā, tale, and the Ākhyāyikā, romance, types which blend with each other. Whether
the subject be an imaginary theme, as is the <i>Vāsavadattā</i> of Subandhu, or a historical one, as in the <i>Harṣacarita</i> of Bāṇa, we find nothing treated as really important save the descriptions as contrasted
with the narrative. The Sanskrit lyric also, in Kālidāsa’s masterpiece, the <i>Meghadūta</i>, is essentially descriptive, as is the Prākrit lyric preserved in the collection
of Hāla, which is based on the model of an older lyric in Sanskrit, whose existence
is revealed to us by the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>.
</p>
<p>The love of description, however, is not new; it is a characteristic of the epic itself,
and the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> in special shows us how the way for the court poetry was being prepared.<a class="noteRef" id="n76.1src" href="#n76.1">114</a> Hence the fact that the verses of the drama are overwhelmingly descriptive, when
not gnomic in character, is no matter for surprise. The peculiarity is a direct inheritance
from the epic.
</p>
<p>This fact has one important bearing on the history of the drama. The suggestion of
Pischel<a class="noteRef" id="n76.2src" href="#n76.2">115</a> that the verses alone were once preserved, and the prose left to be improvised would
have been plausible only if the verses had been essentially the important elements
in the dialogue, as in the supposed Vedic Ākhyāna hymns. But this is assuredly not
the case; the verses do little to help on the action; as in the epic, they express
descriptions of situations and emotions; when movement of the play is requisite recourse
is had to prose. Or the verses serve to set out maxims, as is natural in view of the
great fondness of India for gnomic poetry, seen already in the verses introduced <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>into the legend of Çunaḥçepa in the <i>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</i>. In this again there is a close parallel with the epic, nor is it surprising that
the epic poet, like Açvaghoṣa and Kālidāsa, was often devoted to the drama.
</p>
<p>A further source of literary inspiration must undoubtedly be seen in the work of the
lyric poets, of whose work clear evidence, as well as some scattered fragments, is
preserved to us in the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> of Patañjali.<a class="noteRef" id="n77.1src" href="#n77.1">116</a> Moreover, to these lyric writers it is probable that the drama owed some of its metrical
variety; in the development of the metres with a fixed number of syllables, each of
determined length, from the older and freer Vedic and epic forms, it may be taken
as certain that the erotic poets, who had a narrow theme to handle, and had every
motive to aim at variety of form and effect, must have contributed largely, a conclusion
which is also strongly suggested, if not proved, by the very names of the metres with
their erotic suggestion.<a class="noteRef" id="n77.2src" href="#n77.2">117</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">1.</span> <i>The Çāriputraprakaraṇa</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The discovery of fragments of manuscripts on palm-leaf, of great antiquity, at Turfan,
has through the energy of Professor Lüders revealed to us the existence of at least
three Buddhist dramas. Of one of these the authorship is happily certain, for the
colophon of the last act has been preserved, and it records that the drama was the
<i>Çāriputraprakaraṇa</i> of Açvaghoṣa, son of Suvarṇākṣī; it gives also the fuller title <i>Çāradvatīputraprakaraṇa</i> and the number of acts as nine.
</p>
<p>Açvaghoṣa is an author whose fame, thanks to his error in being a Buddhist long lost
in India, has recently attained renewal by the discovery and publication of his <i>Buddhacarita</i>, a court epic in excellent style and spirit on the life of the Buddha. His <i>Sūtrālaṁkāra</i> is also known through the medium of a Tibetan translation, and illustrates his ability
in turning the tale into an instrument for propaganda in support of the Buddhist faith.
If the tradition which ascribes to him the <i>Mahāyānaçraddhotpāda</i> is correct, he was also the founder or expounder of a subtle system of metaphysics
akin to the Vijñānavāda of the Mahāyāna school, and the <i>Vajrasūcī</i> seems to preserve in some measure the record of his onslaught on the caste system,
which exalted the Brahmins at the expense of the Kṣatriyas, and condemned Buddhism
on the score that it was unfitting that a Kṣatriya like the Buddha should give instructions
to Brahmins. Certainly genuine is the <i>Saundarananda</i>, in the epic manner, which like all his works is devoted to the effective exposition
of Buddhism in the language of polite literature, and also of the Brahmin schools.
We recognize in him one who appreciated that it would never do to allow Buddhism to
remain buried in a form inferior to the best that <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>Brahminism could produce, and it is curious that fate should have preserved the work
of the rival of the Brahmins, while it has permitted his models to disappear. That
he had abundant precedent to guide him is clear from the classical form already assumed
by his dramas; the argument of Professor Konow<a class="noteRef" id="n81.1src" href="#n81.1">1</a> to the contrary, on the ground that many of the standing formulae and characters
are derived from the popular drama, and show that the artistic drama had not developed
yet full independence, is unintelligible, since these features persist throughout
the history of the Sanskrit drama. Nor does any weight attach to the argument that
the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, assumed to be of about the same period as Açvaghoṣa, shows knowledge of only a limited
variety of dramas. On the contrary it is amazing how much literature must have preceded
to permit of the setting up of the main types of drama, some of which were evidently
represented by many specimens, though others doubtless rested on a small basis of
practice.
</p>
<p>The brief fragments preserved of the drama of Açvaghoṣa give us the certainty of his
authorship if any doubt could exist after the colophon, for one verse is taken bodily
from the <i>Buddhacarita</i>, just as he twice refers in the <i>Sūtrālaṁkāra</i> to that important work. The story of the play is clear; it deals with the events
which led up to the conversion of the young Maudgalyāyana and Çāriputra by the Buddha,
and some of the incidents are certain. Çāriputra had an interview with Açvajit; then
he discussed the question of the claims of the Buddha to be a teacher with his friend,
the Vidūṣaka, who raised the objection that a Brahmin like his master should not accept
the teaching of a Kṣatriya; Çāriputra repels the objection by reminding his friend
that medicine aids the sick though given by one of inferior caste, as does water one
aheat. Maudgalyāyana greets Çāriputra, inquiring of him the cause of his glad appearance,
and learns his reasons. The two go to the Buddha, who receives them, and who foretells
to them that they will be the highest in knowledge and magic power of his disciples.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>In this point there is a deliberate and certainly artistic deviation from the ordinary
version of the incident, followed in the <i>Buddhacarita</i>, in which the prophecy of the Buddha is addressed, not to the disciples themselves,
but to others of the Buddha’s followers. The end of the play is marked by a philosophic
dialogue between Çāriputra and the Buddha, which includes a polemic against the belief
in the existence of a permanent self; it terminates in a praise of his two new disciples
by the Buddha, and a formal benediction.
</p>
<p>The most remarkable thing regarding this drama is its close correspondence to the
classical type as laid down in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>. The piece is a Prakaraṇa, and it has nine acts, which accords perfectly with the
rule of the Çāstra; the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> and <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> have ten apiece; the Acts bear no titles, but this is in accord with the normal usage,
though the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> gives names. The hero is Çāriputra, who corresponds to the Brahmin hero of the Çāstra,
and who is emphatically of the noble and calm type enjoined by that authority. Whether
the heroine was a lady or a hetaera we do not know, nor does it appear how far the
poet altered the subject-matter by invention, which is normally the case with later
Prakaraṇas. The Buddha and his disciples, including, beside the two heroes, Kauṇḍinya
and a Çramaṇa speak Sanskrit, and use both prose and verse; the Vidūṣaka speaks Prākrit.
The presence of this figure is a remarkable proof of the fixed character attained
by the drama, for in itself there is nothing more absurd than that a youthful ascetic
seeking after truth should be encumbered by one who is a meet attendant on a wealthy
merchant, Brahmin, or minister. It can, therefore, only be supposed that Açvaghoṣa
was writing a type of drama in which the rôle was far too firmly embedded to permit
its omission, and presumably in the story of the drama now lost to us the Vidūṣaka
served to introduce comic relief. With natural good taste, he disappears from the
last Act, where Çāriputra has no need as a member of the Buddha’s fraternity for encumbrances
like a jester.
</p>
<p>In one point only has it been claimed to find a clear discrepancy between Açvaghoṣa’s
practice and that of the later drama. At the close the theory<a class="noteRef" id="n82.1src" href="#n82.1">2</a> requires that the question, ‘Is <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>there anything further that you desire (<i lang="und">ataḥ param api priyam asti</i>)?’ be addressed to the hero by himself or another, to which he replies by uttering
a benediction styled the Bharatavākya. In the drama of Açvaghoṣa the phrase is omitted,
and the benediction proceeds, without prelude, with the words, ‘From now on shall
these two ever increase their knowledge, restraining their senses, to gain release’,
spoken by the Buddha, not by the hero. Lüders concludes hence that the regular form
of close was not yet established by Açvaghoṣa’s time. The conclusion is clearly fallacious,
and rests on a failure to recognize in this the readiness of Açvaghoṣa to give effect
to a traditional usage, while not slavishly following it. It would obviously have
been absurd to place the last words in the drama in the form of a benediction in the
mouth of any one save the Buddha, and therefore he speaks the benediction. To preface
it with the usual formula was needless in his case, but the opening words of the verse
are <i lang="und">ataḥ param</i>, which is obviously not an incredible coincidence, but a deliberate reference to
the ordinary phrase. Açvaghoṣa shows thus his knowledge of the rule and his power
to vary it in case of need. Similarly Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa in the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e3415" title="Source: Venīsaṁhāra">Veṇīsaṁhāra</span></i> puts the Bharatavākya in the mouth of Yudhiṣṭhira, but he makes Kṛṣṇa end the play
by according the favour prayed for by Yudhiṣṭhira. He too felt that it would be absurd
to leave the omnipotent one in the position of listening without response to the utterance
of a benediction by one who cannot be more than an inferior, though nominally the
hero.<a class="noteRef" id="n83.1src" href="#n83.1">3</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Allegorical and the Hetaera Dramas</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The same manuscript which contains portions of the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e3433" title="Source: Çariputraprakaraṇa">Çāriputraprakaraṇa</span></i> has also fragments of two other dramas. There is no evidence of their authorship,
other than the fact that they appear in the same manuscript as the work of Açvaghoṣa,
and that they display the same general appearance as the work of that writer. That
they are Açvaghoṣa’s is much more probable than that they are the work of some unknown
contemporary.<a class="noteRef" id="n83.2src" href="#n83.2">4</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first of these is specially interesting as it represents a type of which we have
otherwise no earlier specimen than the <i>Prabodhacandrodaya</i> of Kṛṣṇamiçra. We find the allegorical figures of Buddhi, wisdom, Kīrti, fame, and
Dhṛti, firmness, appearing and conversing. This is followed by the advent of the Buddha
himself, adorned with the halo which he borrowed from Greek art. We do not know whether
he appeared later in actual conversation with the allegorical figures, but for this
mixture of the real and the ideal we have to go beyond Kṛṣṇamiçra, who represents
all his characters as abstract, Viṣṇu for instance by Faith in Viṣṇu, to Kavikarṇapūra’s
glorification of Caitanya in the sixteenth century, in which allegorical figures are
mingled with Caitanya and his followers, though they do not actually converse together.<a class="noteRef" id="n84.1src" href="#n84.1">5</a> It must remain uncertain whether there was a train of tradition leading from Açvaghoṣa
to Kṛṣṇamiçra, or whether the latter created the type of drama afresh; the former
theory is the more likely. The characters all speak Sanskrit, but the fragments are
too short to give us any real information on the general trend of the play.
</p>
<p>The other drama gives us more interesting matter. It is one in which figures a hetaera
named Magadhavatī, a Vidūṣaka named Komudhagandha, a hero styled only Nāyaka, but
probably named Somadatta, a Duṣṭa, rogue, without further name, a certain Dhānaṁjaya,
who may possibly be a prince if the term ‘king’s son’ (<i lang="und">bhaṭṭidālaka</i>), which is recognized in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> as the style of the younger princes of the blood, applies to him, a maid-servant,
and Çāriputra and Maudgalyāyana. The drama was doubtless intended for purposes of
religious edification, but what we have is too fragmentary to do more than show that
the author was possessed of humour and that the Vidūṣaka was already a hungry soul.
The drama alludes to an old garden as the place where part of the action passed, as
in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, and also as in that drama the house of the hetaera served as the scene of another
part of the action. The characters are often introduced as entering in vehicles (<i lang="und">pravahaṇa</i>), a further point of <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>similarity to that drama, while an allusion to a Samāja or festival on a hill-top
accords with the frequent reference to such amusements in Buddhist literature. An
obscure character is a person, obviously of lower rank, who is styled Gobaṁ°.
</p>
<p>The drama shows close agreement with the classical model; the name of the Vidūṣaka
is evidence of this, for not only is it connected with a real Brahmin family, but
it obeys the rule that the name of that character should indicate a flower, the spring,
&amp;c., for it means literally ‘the offspring of the lotus-smelling’. The name of the
hetaera does not observe the rule exemplified in the <i>Cārudatta</i> that the hetaera’s name should end in <i lang="und">senā</i>, <i lang="und">siddhā</i>, or <i lang="und">dattā</i>, but, apart from the fact that the authority for the rule is very late, the name
was very probably given to the poet by the literary tradition. The fact that the Duṣṭa
and the Nāyaka appear by these titles only has a parallel in the <i>Cārudatta</i> and the Buddhist drama of Harṣa, the <i>Nāgānanda</i>, but it is difficult to say whether or not this is a sign of antiquity.
</p>
<p>The material available in the case of any of the three dramas is too scanty to give
us any assurance as to what the practice was regarding the introduction, especially
the use of the Nāndī, or verse of benediction. What is certain is that the Pāripārçvika,
or assistant of the Sūtradhāra in the later literature, is found apparently as taking
part in the opening of the drama, perhaps the <i>Çāriputraprakaraṇa</i>.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>The Language of the Dramas</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In accordance with the later rules we find the Buddha, his disciples, the hero of
the hetaera play and Dhānaṁjaya speaking Sanskrit; the same is true of the allegorical
characters, and this is also in accord with later practice, for in both Kṛṣṇamiçra
and Kavikarṇapūra’s works some of the allegorical characters speak Sanskrit, though
others, of more feminine appeal and character, speak Prākrit. One Çramaṇa speaks Sanskrit,
another—conceivably an Ājīvika—a Prākrit.
</p>
<p>The Sanskrit contains some errors, which are obvious Prākritisms, and which it would
be unjust to attribute to the author, or authors. Genuine departures from the norm
are scanty; the use of <i lang="und">ārttha</i> for <i lang="und">artha</i> has a precise parallel in the nearly contemporaneous dialect of Mathurā; <i lang="und">tuṣṇīm</i> is frequent in <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>Buddhist Sanskrit as well as etymologically correct; <i lang="und">krimi</i> is found also in the <i>Buddhacarita</i> where the reading <i lang="und">kṛmi</i> would spoil the metre; <i lang="und">pratīgṛhīta</i> has many Sanskrit parallels. In <i lang="und">pradveṣam</i> where the metre requires <i lang="und">pradoṣam</i> Buddhist influence is doubtless present, but <i lang="und">yeva</i> and <i lang="und">tāva</i> are probably merely errors of the scribe, to whom may be assigned such a monstrosity
as <i lang="und">paçyemas</i> and <i>Somadattassa</i>. But <i lang="und">bhagavāṁ</i> has the support of the practice of the <i>Mahāvastu</i> where stems in <i lang="und">mat</i> and <i lang="und">vat</i> end thus, and it explains the Sandhi <i>çṛṇvam puṣpā</i>. These are minimal variants; in the main the Sanskrit is excellent and the fragments
shows traces of the able versification and style of Açvaghoṣa.
</p>
<p>The other characters speak Prākrit, and, by a curious variation from the normal practice,
the stage directions, which are freely given as in the classical drama, are normally
expressed in the language which the character concerned uses, though there are cases
of mixture and apparent confusion which may be due to the scribe. Three different
forms of Prākrit may be distinguished, the first spoken by the Duṣṭa, the second by
the mysterious Gobaṁ°, and the third by the hetaera and Vidūṣaka.
</p>
<p>The Duṣṭa’s speech in three important points is similar to the Māgadhī of the Prākrit
grammarians; it substitutes <i>l</i> for <i>r</i>; reduces all three sibilants to <i>ç</i>; and has <i>e</i> in the nominative singular of masculine nouns in <i>a</i>. But it ignores the rules of the grammarians in certain matters; hard letters are
not softened (e.g. <i lang="und">bhoti</i>), nor soft consonants elided (e.g. <i lang="und">komudagandha</i>), when intervocalic. There is no tendency to cerebralize <i>n</i>, and in <i lang="und">kālanā</i> the dental replaces the cerebral. Fuller forms of consonants remain in <i lang="und">han̄gho</i> (<i lang="und">haṅho</i>) and <i lang="und">bambhaṇa</i> (<i lang="und">bamhaṇa</i>). The later forms of development of consonantal combinations are unknown; thus for
<i>rj</i> we have <i>jj</i>, not <i>yy</i>, as in <i>ajja</i>; <i>cch</i> remains in lieu of becoming <i>çc</i>; <i>kṣ</i> becomes <i>kkh</i>, not <i>sk</i> or <i>ẖk</i>; <i>ṣṭ</i> and <i>ṣṭh</i> give <i>ṭṭh</i>, not <i>sṭ</i>. In <i lang="und">kiçça</i> we have an older form than <i lang="und">kīça</i>, in <i lang="und">ahakaṁ</i> than <i lang="und">ahake</i>, <i lang="und">hake</i>, <i lang="und">hage</i>. In practically all these details we must see an earlier stage of what becomes Māgadhī
in the grammarians. With it may be compared the metrical inscription of the Jogīmārā
cave on the Rāmgarh hill which belongs to the period of Açoka.
</p>
<p>The Prākrit of the Gobaṁ° agrees with this Old Māgadhī in having <i>l</i> for <i>r</i> and <i>e</i> in the nominative singular, but it reduces all <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>sibilants to <i>s</i>. It thus shows a certain similarity to the Ardha-Māgadhī of the grammarians, but
that dialect often keeps <i>r</i> though it frequently alters it to <i>l</i>; for instance it has <i>r</i> for the <i lang="und">kaleti</i> of this Prākrit and the Old Māgadhī. Other points of similarity are the retention
of the dental for cerebral in <i lang="und">vanna</i>; the lengthening of the vowel before the suffix <i lang="und">ka</i> (<i lang="und">vannīkāhi</i>); the accusative plural neuter in <i lang="und">pupphā</i>; and the infinitive <i lang="und">bhuṁjitaye</i> (<i lang="und">bhuñjittae</i>). There are points of difference, but they are probably all cases of earlier forms.
Thus, as in Old Māgadhī, we have no softening or loss of intervocalic consonants;
<i>n</i> is not cerebralised, but even introduced in <i lang="und">palinata</i>; <i>ḷ</i> appears in lieu of <i>l</i>; the instrumental in <i>āhi</i> has no nasal; the nominative of <i lang="und">vat</i> stems appears as in <i lang="und">vā</i>, as against <i lang="und">vaṁ</i> or <i lang="und">vante</i>; in the infinitive we find no doubling of the consonant in <i lang="und">taye</i>. The fact, however, of the regular change of <i>r</i> to <i>l</i> and the use of the form <i lang="und">yeva</i> after a long vowel as in Māgadhī and Pāli show that the Old Ardha-Māgadhī was more
akin to Māgadhī than the later Ardha-Māgadhī, which came steadily under the influence
of the western dialects as shown by the tendency to change <i>e</i> of the nominative to <i>o</i>.
</p>
<p>There are strong points of similarity between this Old Ardha-Māgadhī and the language
of Açoka’s pillar inscriptions. They agree as regards the use of <i>l</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>e</i>, the dentals in <i lang="und">palinata</i> and <i lang="und">vannīkāhi</i>, <i lang="und">yeva</i> after long vowels, and the long vowel before the suffix <i lang="und">ka</i>. They disagree in the nominative and accusative plural neuter of <i>a</i> stems, which have <i>āni</i> in the inscriptions as against <i>ā</i>, but that is of no great importance, as these are doublets. The infinitive, however,
is in <i lang="und">tave</i>, which cannot be equated with <i lang="und">taye</i>; Ardha-Māgadhī <i lang="und">ttae</i> may be from either.
</p>
<p>The Açokan dialect is doubtless the court speech of his kingdom, and a descendant
of the Ardha-Māgadhī of Mahāvīra, the founder of the Jain religion, and probably also
of the Buddha, whose speech was clearly not akin to the Māgadhī of the grammarians,
though it is called Māgadhī in the sacred texts.<a class="noteRef" id="n87.1src" href="#n87.1">6</a>
</p>
<p>The theory of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> assigns Ardha-Māgadhī as the language of savants, sons of kings or Rājputs, and Çreṣṭhins,
rich merchants, but, with the exception of Bhāsa’s <i>Karṇabhāra</i>, it does not appear in the extant dramas. Māgadhī, on the contrary, <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>is required in the case of men who live in the women’s apartments, diggers of underground
passages, keepers of drink shops, watchers, the hero himself in time of danger, and
the Çakāra. Into which category the Duṣṭa falls is not certain; the <i>Daçarūpa</i> ascribes this Prākrit to low people in general.
</p>
<p>Çaurasenī is ascribed to the hetaera by the Çāstra which gives Prācyā or eastern dialect
to the Vidūṣaka, but it is clear that the Prācyā is a mere variety of Çaurasenī, from
which it differs only in the use of certain expressions. This is borne out by the
dramas, in which there is no real distinction between the speech of these two characters.
With the Çaurasenī of the grammarians it shows remarkable parallels. It has <i>r</i> in lieu of changing it to <i>l</i>; it reduces the sibilants to <i>s</i>; and for the nominative masculine it has <i>o</i>. Further, it changes <i>kṣ</i> into <i>kkh</i>, not <i>cch</i>; for <i lang="und">chard</i> it has <i lang="und">chaḍḍ</i>, for <i lang="und">mard</i>, <i lang="und">madd</i>; for <i lang="und">saçrīkam</i> irregularly <i lang="und">sassirīkaṁ</i> with the double <i>s</i> despite the epenthetic vowel; and in the third singular future <i lang="und">issiti</i>. The gerund <i lang="und">kariya</i> is parallel to <i lang="und">karia</i> in Hemacandra’s grammar; <i lang="und">bhaṭṭā</i> is the vocative of <i lang="und">bhartṛ</i>; <i lang="und">iyaṁ</i> is feminine as later <i lang="und">iaṁ</i> in Çaurasenī alone; <i lang="und">bhavāṁ</i> as nominative is comparable with <i lang="und">bhavaṁ</i>; <i lang="und">bhaṇ</i> is conjugated in the ninth class; <i lang="und">viya</i> is parallel to <i lang="und">via</i> for <i lang="und">iva</i>; and <i lang="und">dāni</i> with loss of <i>i</i> as a particle is similar to <i lang="und">dāṇiṁ</i>.
</p>
<p>In other cases the forms of this Prākrit are clearly older than those of the grammarians’
Çaurasenī. As in the other Prākrits of the drama, there is no softening or omission
of intervocalic consonants, and no cerebralization of <i>n</i>. Further, initial <i>y</i> is kept, not reduced to <i>j</i>; the interjection <i>ai</i> in lieu of <i>aï</i> is supported by the language of the Girnār and Udayagiri inscriptions; in <i>nirussāsam</i> we have an older form than <i>ūsasida</i> of Çaurasenī; <i>jñ</i> and <i>ny</i> give <i>ññ</i>, not the later <i>ṇṇ</i>; <i>dy</i> gives <i>yy</i> (written <i>y</i>) for <i>jj</i>; <i>tuvaṁ</i> and <i>tava</i> are both manifestly older than the forms <i>tumaṁ</i> and <i>tuha</i>, while <i>karotha</i> is a remarkable example of the preservation of the old strong base. Old also is the
preservation of the long vowel in <i>bhavāṁ</i>. In <i>adaṇḍāraho</i> and the dubious <i>arhessi</i> we have two variants on the rule of Çaurasenī, which has <i>i</i> as the epenthetic vowel in <i>arh</i>, but this merely illustrates the uncertainty of these epentheses; <i>duguṇa</i> in lieu of <i>diuṇa</i> is not older, but a variant mode of treating <i>dviguṇa</i>, and there is no special difficulty in holding that <i>dāṇi</i> and <i>idāṇi</i> are forms which <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>were originally doublets of <i>dāṇiṁ</i> and <i>idāṇiṁ</i> in Çaurasenī, and later were superseded. From other Prākrit passages, presumably
in the same Old Çaurasenī, we obtain old forms like <i>vayaṁ</i>, we, and <i>tumhākaṁ</i> in lieu of <i>tumhāṇaṁ</i>; <i>edisa</i> for <i>erisa</i> or <i>īdisa</i>; <i>dissati</i> for <i>dīsadi</i>; <i>gahītaṁ</i> for <i>gahidaṁ</i>; <i>khu</i> is kept after short vowels in lieu of being doubled; a long vowel is kept before
<i>tti</i> and such forms as <i>mhi</i>. The future in <i>gamissāma</i> is probably old, while <i>nikkhanta</i> and <i>bambhaṇa</i> admit of this explanation against the later <i>nikkanta</i> and <i>bamhaṇa</i>.
</p>
<p>In the words of the hetaera the word <i>surada</i> occurs, with softening of <i>t</i> to <i>d</i>; conceivably the passage might be verse, but in all probability we are merely faced
with a sporadic instance of a change which later set in, due perhaps to a copyist’s
error; to find in it an evidence of Māhārāṣṭrī would be unwise, especially as the
very next word (<i>vimadda</i>) is not in the Māhārāṣṭrī form (<i>vimaḍḍa</i>). In the dialect of the Duṣṭa we have a form <i>makkaṭaho</i> which may be genitive, as in Apabhraṅça, but is not allowed in Māgadhī; but the sense
is too uncertain to permit of any security.
</p>
<p>The existence and literary use of these Prākrits is most interesting in the history
both of the language and the literature, for they present archaic features which place
them on the same plane of change as Pāli and the dialects of the older inscriptions.
They may be set beside the inscriptions in the Sītābengā and Jogīmārā caves on the
Rāmgarh hill, which both show lyric strophes. The influence of the Kāvya style in
Sanskrit can be traced obviously in the later Nāsik inscription in Prākrit of the
second century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, and even in the inscription of Khāravela of Kalin̄ga perhaps in the second century
<span class="asc">B.C.</span><a class="noteRef" id="n89.1src" href="#n89.1">7</a> We cannot, therefore, see any plausibility in the idea of the gradual adaptation
of Sanskrit, a sacred language, to belles lettres; on the contrary the dramas show
that the Prākrits in literature were already under the influence of the Sanskrit Kāvya.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>The Metres</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Scanty as the fragments are, they display another feature significant of the development
of the drama on the classical <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>lines. The metres employed are very numerous, as is natural in a poetry in which the
verse serves essentially the purpose of displaying the skill of the writer. In addition
to the Çloka we find the Upajāti (⏓ - ⏑ - - ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ - -), the Çālinī (- - - -, - ⏑
- - ⏑ - -), Vaṅçasthā (⏑ - ⏑ - - ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ - ⏑ -), Praharṣiṇī (- - -, ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ -
⏑ - -), Vasantatilaka (- - ⏑ - ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ - -), Mālinī (⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ - -, - ⏑
- - ⏑ - -), Çikhariṇī (⏑ - - - - -, ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ - - ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ -), Hariṇī (⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ -, -
- - -, ⏑ - ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ -), Çārdūlavikrīḍita (- - - ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ - ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ -, - - ⏑ - - ⏑ -),
Sragdharā (- - - - ⏑ - -, ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ -, - ⏑ - - ⏑ - -), and Suvadanā (- - - - ⏑ -
-, ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ -, - - ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ -), the last of these metres being almost a stranger to
the drama, though it appears in Bhāsa, in the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i>, and once in Varāhamihira. The tendency to seek sound effects is clear in a Çikhariṇī
verse.
</p>
<p>That so many metres of elaborate form should be found is of great interest, not merely
as testimony of the early development of the Kāvya literature, but also because we
see that the drama as early as Açvaghoṣa, and doubtless long before him, had definitely
accepted the verses not as essential elements of the dialogue as are the verses in
Greek drama, but as more or less ornamental excursions. In the absence of any complete
play we cannot say what proportion of Çlokas was observed by Açvaghoṣa; we may suspect
that it was not higher than in Bhāsa, if so high. Now the Çloka by its comparative
simplicity and brevity, and by the ease of its structure, might well have served the
same purpose in the Indian drama as did the trimeter in that of Greece, and it is
curious to speculate what might have been the fate of the drama if it had been felt
possible to write it throughout in verse. But evidently by Açvaghoṣa’s age the distinction
between prose and stanzas, essentially lyric in type, was fixed, and the elaborate
structure of the stanza, normally with four lines of equal length and identic structure,
the longer lines having also caesuras, rendered it quite unsuitable as a medium of
conversation. Thus early in the drama we find a defect in form which was gradually
to become more and more marked and to render the dialogue, that is the essential feature
of the drama, less and less the subject of the labours of the dramatists.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">1.</span> <i>The Authenticity of Bhāsa’s Dramas</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Until 1910 the existence of any drama of Bhāsa’s was unknown in Europe, and only in
1912 appeared under the editorship of T. Gaṇapati Çāstrin, the first of a series of
thirteen dramas which their discoverer attributed to that poet. The fact, however,
that the dramas themselves are silent as to the authorship rendered careful research
necessary to determine their provenance, and the proofs adduced have not won entire
satisfaction.
</p>
<p>What we knew before the publication of Bhāsa was simply his high reputation. Kālidāsa
in his first work, the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>, refers to Bhāsa, with Saumilla, Kaviputra, and others as his great predecessors
in the art, whose fame renders difficult the acceptance of the work of an untried
author. Bāṇa,<a class="noteRef" id="n91.1src" href="#n91.1">1</a> at the beginning of the seventh century, states that Bhāsa attained fame by his dramas,
begun by the Sūtradhāra, with many rôles and including episodes, as one might by the
erection of temples, begun by the architect, with many stages, and beflagged. It would
be unwise to prove by this that Bhāsa innovated in these regards; what is essential
to Bāṇa is to celebrate Bhāsa’s fame, and to show his wit by the comparison in the
same words with some not very obvious object of comparison. A century later Vākpati<a class="noteRef" id="n91.2src" href="#n91.2">2</a> declares his pleasure in Bhāsa, friend of fire (<i>jalaṇamitte</i>), in the author of the <i>Raghuvaṅça</i>, in Subandhu and Hāricandra. Rājaçekhara (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 900) places him among the classical poets, and a verse records a curious incident:
‘Critics cast on the fire, to test it, the discus composed of the dramas of Bhāsa;
the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> did not succumb to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>flames’.<a class="noteRef" id="n92.1src" href="#n92.1">3</a> The verse, however, contains a <i>double entendre</i> strangely ignored by Professor Konow;<a class="noteRef" id="n92.2src" href="#n92.2">4</a> it denotes of course the superiority of the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> to the other dramas of Bhāsa—a fact which the published plays bear out to the full—but
it also alludes to a reason; the play itself contains a fire, which was feigned by
the minister to permit the possibility of the king’s new marriage, and it is only
appropriate that, as that fire could not burn the queen, so the fire which tried the
play was unable to prevail against it. The passage throws the necessary light on the
term ‘friend of fire’ of Vākpati, which should not be rendered meaningless by attributing
it to the fact that Bhāsa often mentions fire in his dramas.
</p>
<p>These facts are, it must at once be admitted, extremely favourable to the authenticity
of the dramas; taken all in all they are clearly the work of a very considerable writer;
in technique they are less finished than those of Kālidāsa; the Prākrit is clearly
earlier than that of the works of Kālidāsa or the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>; the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> is clearly the best, and it explains Vākpati and Rājaçekhara’s references. Bāṇa’s
statement regarding the opening of the plays by the Sūtradhāra is proved by the dramas.
There is also substantial evidence to be derived from the writers on rhetoric. Bhāmaha,
who may belong to the beginning of the eighth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, criticizes severely the plot of the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>; Vāmana, in the eighth, cites from that play, the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i>, and the <i>Cārudatta</i>; Abhinavagupta (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1000) twice names the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i>, and mentions the <i>Cārudatta</i>. These references are not in themselves conclusive, for they do not mention Bhāsa
as the author of the plays, even when these are named,<a class="noteRef" id="n92.3src" href="#n92.3">5</a> and not merely cited from or discussed, but they show that the critics knew and were
prepared to cite these dramas, which means that they accepted the view that they were
by an important author. The ascription of the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> to Bhāsa gives us the right to accept his authorship of the rest if internal evidence
supports it. That this is so is undeniable, <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>even by those who suspect the attribution to Bhāsa; the coincidences in technique,
in the Prākrits, in metre, and in style are overwhelming. Finally, there is the evidence
of the <i>Cārudatta</i>; it is undeniably and obviously the prototype of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, and it proves, therefore, that the dramas are older than that work which was well
known by Vāmana, and is certainly a good deal earlier.
</p>
<p>The arguments<a class="noteRef" id="n93.1src" href="#n93.1">6</a> against the authenticity are all inconclusive. They are based on the fact that a
drama, <i>Mattavilāsa</i>, of Mahendravikramavarman, of the seventh century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> presents the same characteristics as regards the form of opening the drama as the
plays of Bhāsa, and the suggestion that Rājasiṅha is to be identified with a prince
of the south of that name (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 675). The evidence is clearly inadequate; Bhāsa’s fame was evidently more prevalent
in the south than in the north, for a scene from one of his plays has survived in
a mutilated form in the popular theatre there, and it is easy to understand how a
seventh-century writer imitated him in technique. Moreover, the imitation is very
partial; the omission of the name of the author and the play is not followed, and
this is certainly a sign of a later date for the <i>Mattavilāsa</i>. The guess regarding the identification of the king is without probative force, for
the term seems deliberately vague, and is in keeping with the silence of the author
regarding his own name and that of his drama. The introduction of immediate reality
is incongruous, and, therefore, avoided.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Date of Bhāsa’s Dramas</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is difficult to arrive at any precise determination of Bhāsa’s date. That Kālidāsa
knew his fame as firmly established is clear, and, if we may fairly safely date Kālidāsa
about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 400, this gives us a period of not later than <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 350 for Bhāsa. The fact of his priority to the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> leads us to no definite result, for the view that this play is to be placed before
Kālidāsa in the third century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> is not at all plausible. An upper limit is given by the fact that Bhāsa is doubtless
later than Açvaghoṣa, whose <i>Buddhacarita</i> is probably the source of a <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>verse in the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>, and whose Prākrit is assuredly and unquestionably older in character. It is useless
to seek to estimate by the evidence of the Prākrit whether Bhāsa is more closely allied
in date to Kālidāsa than to Açvaghoṣa, because changes in speech and the representation
of them in literature are matters which do not in the slightest degree permit of exact
valuation in terms of years. The most that can be said is that it may be held without
improbability that Bhāsa is nearer to Kālidāsa’s period than to Açvaghoṣa’s.
</p>
<p>An effort at more exact determination is made by Professor Konow<a class="noteRef" id="n94.1src" href="#n94.1">7</a> on the ground that Bhāsa’s dramas in part deal with the story of Udayana, of which
Ujjayinī was specially fond, as we know from Kālidāsa. Hence we may assume that the
home of the poet was Ujjayinī, an assumption which obviously is not legitimate in
any degree. Further we may assume that he lived under one of the Western Kṣatrapas,
which again goes too far. Now the usual ending of a drama is not regularly observed
in Bhāsa’s dramas; the introductory question is found only in the <i>Avimāraka</i>, <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>, <i>Bālacarita</i>, and <i>Dūtavākya</i>. The description of the final benediction as Bharatavākya is omitted in the <i>Madhyamavyāyoga</i>, where Viṣṇu is praised; in the <i>Dūtaghaṭotkaca</i>, where his commands are given; in the <i>Pañcarātra</i>, where the wish is expressed that the king (<i>rājasiṅha</i>) should rule the whole earth; and in the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i>, where the wish is that the prince should conquer his foes and rule the earth. In
the other plays a change of form of the Bharatavākya is asserted; in the <i>Karṇabhāra</i> there is the desire for the disappearance of misfortune; in the <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i> the wish is that the king may fare as Rāma who was reunited with Sītā and his kinsmen;
in the <i>Avimāraka</i>, the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i>, and the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>, that the king should, after destroying his foes, rule the whole earth, while in
the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i>, <i>Dūtavākya</i>, and <i>Bālacarita</i>, the wish is for universal rule. This suggests that for a time the king reigned in
peace; then enemies arose and disturbed his power; finally he again won the upper
hand, and his friends could without absurdity pray for his attaining imperial rank.
This would agree with the history of the Kṣatrapa Rudrasiṅha, who held from 181–8,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>again from <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 191–6 the high rank of Mahākṣatrapa, and whose name may be hinted at in the use of
the term <i>rājasiṅha</i>. That the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i> is older than the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> is held to support this suggestion, but it is clearly without any merit save ingenuity.
</p>
<p>Nor is there more to be said for Konow’s other suggestions of date; the fact that
the term Nāṭaka is used, and that the Vidūṣaka appears, cannot show that he is early,
for they are used on continuously to the latest days of the drama, and the view that
Bhāsa was an innovator who shortened the preliminaries, which is given as a reason
for making him early, because the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> gives the preliminaries in detail, is abandoned <i>sub silentio</i> in the author’s later work,<a class="noteRef" id="n95.1src" href="#n95.1">8</a> where it is candidly admitted that we do not know whether he shortened the preliminaries
at all. Nor can we say anything regarding his relation to the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e4218" title="Source: Nāṭyaçastra">Nāṭyaçāstra</span></i> which will aid us to a date; there is even a tradition that he himself wrote on the
theory of the drama. Nor can any weight be attached to the view that Bhāsa stands
nearer Açvaghoṣa in technique than Kālidāsa; these matters do not permit of precise
evaluation in time, and, if we place Bhāsa about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 300, we go as far as the evidence allows.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>The Dramas and their Sources</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The derivation of the drama in part from epic recitations is peculiarly clear in Bhāsa,
who shows the influence of the two great epics in its clearest form. In the <i>Madhyamavyāyoga</i><a class="noteRef" id="n95.2src" href="#n95.2">9</a> we have a reminiscence of the tale of the love of the demon Hiḍimbā for Bhīma, the
third of the five Pāṇḍavas, and their marriage which has Ghaṭotkaca as its fruit,
though the parents part. The play opens with preliminary rites, after which the director
pronounces a benediction on the audience, and begins to address them, but is suddenly
interrupted by a sound, which is revealed as the cry of a Brahmin, who with his three
sons and his wife is being pursued by the demon Ghaṭotkaca. The demon has received
orders from his mother to bring her a victim; he offers, therefore, <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>to spare the rest of the family, if one is willing to go with him, and the midmost,
Madhyama, of the sons decides to go, though there is a generous rivalry among the
three in self-sacrifice. He asks, however, time to go to perform a rite of purification,
and, as he tarries, the demon in anger calls aloud for him. Bhīma responds, as the
midmost of the Pāṇḍavas; he will go in the boy’s place, but not by force. The demon,
not knowing his father, seeks to compel him, but, failing, accepts his offer to go
willingly. Hiḍimbā greets her husband with joy, and reproaches her son and bids him
express regret. She explains that her demand was made expressly to win for her a visit
from Bhīma, who suggests that they should all accompany the aged Brahmin and his family
to their destination, and with a verse in praise of Viṣṇu the piece ends.
</p>
<p>Ghaṭotkaca is again the leading figure of the <i>Dūtaghaṭotkaca</i>, which may also be classed as a Vyāyoga, a term indicating primarily a military spectacle.
The Kurus are jubilant over the defeat of Abhimanyu, Arjuna’s son, at the hands of
Jayadratha, though Dhṛtarāṣṭra warns them of the dangers that overshadow them. Ghaṭotkaca
appears to them and predicts their punishment at the hands of Arjuna. Of the same
general type apparently is the <i>Karṇabhāra</i> which deals with Karṇa’s armour; he makes himself ready for his fight with Arjuna,
and tells Çalya, the Madra king, of the trick by which he won it from the great Paraçurāma,
though the latter retaliated for the deception by the curse that the arms should fail
him in the hour of his need. The curse is fulfilled, for Indra comes in the guise
of a Brahmin and obtains from Karṇa his weapons and earrings. Karṇa and Çalya go out
to battle, and the sound of Arjuna’s chariot is heard. In the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i> the fight between Bhīma and Duryodhana, greatest of the Kurus, ends in the breaking
of the thigh of the latter, who falls in agony; his son comes to him in his childish
way, but his father is fain to save him the sorrow of his plight. His parents and
wives surround him; he seeks to comfort them; Açvatthāman swears vengeance despite
his counsels of peace; visions of his brothers and Apsarases float before him, and
he passes away.
</p>
<p>These four plays have each but one Act; the <i>Pañcarātra</i>, on the other hand, has three, and may perhaps be classed as a <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>Samavakāra, in so far at least as it is a drama in which there are more heroes of
sorts than one, and they more or less attain their ends, which seem to be the chief
features of that dubious kind of play in the theory. It reflects the period when efforts
are being made to save the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas from the fatal conflict, which ends
in the ruin of the former and grave loss to the latter. Droṇa has undertaken a sacrifice
for Duryodhana, and seeks as the fee the grant to the Pāṇḍavas of half the realm to
which they had a just claim. Duryodhana promises on condition that they are heard
of within five days. Virāṭa, however, is missing from those present at the offering;
he has to mourn the loss of a hundred<a class="noteRef" id="n97.1src" href="#n97.1">10</a> Kīcakas. Bhīṣma suspects that Bhīma must be at the bottom of this illhap, and on
his instigation at the end of Act II it is decided to raid Virāṭa’s cows, as he hopes
thus to bring the facts to light. The foray, however, fails, for the Pāṇḍavas are
with Virāṭa in disguise; Abhimanyu is taken prisoner and married to Virāṭa’s daughter.
The charioteer in Act III brings back the news, showing clearly that Arjuna and Bhīma
have taken part in the contest, but none the less Duryodhana decides to keep faith.
</p>
<p>The <i>Dūtavākya</i>, a Vyāyoga in one act, is again from the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, but deals with the Kṛṣṇa legend. Bhīṣma is made chief of the Kuru forces; the arrival
of Nārāyaṇa is announced, but Duryodhana forbids that any honour be shown to him,
and seats himself before a picture, in which is depicted the indignity shown to Draupadī,
when her husband gambled her away at dice. Kṛṣṇa enters, making a deep impression
on all by his majesty; even Duryodhana falls from his seat. The messenger demands
the half of the realm for the Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana refuses and seeks to bind the envoy.
Enraged, he calls for his magic weapons, but finally he consents to lay aside his
wrath, and receives the homage of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. It is interesting to note that the
play, in describing the picture, omits any allusion to the miracle by which in the
epic Kṛṣṇa himself is represented as providing the unhappy Draupadī with fresh raiment
as soon as each garment is dragged from her in insult. But it would be extremely unwise
to assume with Professor Winternitz<a class="noteRef" id="n97.2src" href="#n97.2">11</a> that this <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>fact proves that Bhāsa did not know of this episode, and that it was interpolated
after his time in the epic. Obviously it would have ruined the effect of the picture
if such a fact had been hinted at in it, apart from the difficulty of exhibiting this
by the painter’s art, and Bhāsa is clearly justified on artistic grounds in allowing
this episode to be passed over.
</p>
<p>Of far greater importance is the <i>Bālacarita</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n98.1src" href="#n98.1">12</a> which presents us with a lively and vivid picture of the feats of Kṛṣṇa, culminating
in the slaying of Kaṅsa, a brilliant exemplification of the value of Patañjali’s evidence
as to the growth of drama. The director enters, pronounces a verse of benediction
asking the favour of the god, who is Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, Rāma, and Kṛṣṇa in the four
ages of the world; he announces the advent of the sage Nārada and retires. Nārada
explains that he has come from the heaven to gaze on the young Kṛṣṇa, born in the
family of the Vṛṣṇis as son of Devakī and Vasudeva, who is in truth Nārāyaṇa incarnate
to destroy Kaṅsa. He sees the infant, pays homage, and departs. Devakī and Vasudeva
appear on the stage; they have joy in the birth of a son, but terror, for Kaṅsa has
slain already six sons of theirs and will slay the seventh—a deviation in number from
our other sources which make Kṛṣṇa the eighth child. Vasudeva takes the infant and
decides to remove it from Kaṅsa’s reach. He leaves the city, but the child’s weight
is as colossal as that of Mount Mandara; the darkness is impenetrable, but a marvellous
light comes from the child, and the Yamunā makes dry a path for him to cross. The
spirit of the tree under which he rests brings to him the cowherd Nanda, bearing a
dead maiden, an infant just borne by his wife Yaçodā, who, fallen in a faint, does
not know whether the child is a boy or a girl. Nanda gives aid reluctantly, but in
memory of past favours. He seeks first to purify himself from contact with the dead,
but a spring of water shoots forth and renders labour needless. He takes the boy,
but his weight proves too great. Now appear in the guise of herdsmen the weapons of
Kṛṣṇa and his steed, who present themselves each with a verse, ‘I am the bird, Garuḍa,’
&amp;c., ‘I am the discus’, ‘I the bow’, ‘I the club’, ‘I the conch’, and ‘I the sword’.
At the request of the discus the infant consents to become light, and Nanda bears
him away. Vasudeva finds the dead child awakened <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>to life in his arms, and the weight of it is oppressive, but the Yamunā once more
gives dry passage, and he returns to Mathurā and Devakī. Act II opens with an entr’acte
in Kaṅsa’s palace. The curse pronounced on him by the seer Madhuka enters, guised
as a Caṇḍāla in hateful form with a necklace of skulls; he and his retinue of Caṇḍālīs
force their way into the heart of the palace; the royal fortune, Rājaçrī, would bar
their way, but the curse announces that it is Viṣṇu’s will that he enter, and she
yields; the curse seizes then hold of Kaṅsa. The Act then presents Kaṅsa uneasy and
distressed by the portents of the night; he summons his astrologer and his domestic
priests, who warn him that the portents presage the birth of a god. Kaṅsa has Vasudeva
summoned, is told of the birth of a daughter, refuses to spare the child, and hurls
it against a rock. But part only of the lifeless body falls to earth; the rest rises
to heaven, and the dread figure of the goddess Kārtyāyanī appears to the king. Her
retinue come also, announcing each his advent with a verse, and declare their purpose
to destroy Kaṅsa. In the meantime, in herdsmen’s guise they will go to the home of
the child to share in the sports of the herdsmen.
</p>
<p>The entr’acte before Act III tells us in the mouths of the herdsmen of their joys
since Kṛṣṇa came to live with them, and an old man relates in a long Prākrit speech
his wonderful deeds, including the destruction of the demons, Pūtanā, Çakaṭa, Yamala
and Arjuna, Pralamba, Dhenuka, and Keçin. We are told then that Kṛṣṇa or Dāmodara,
the name won from an adventure, has gone to the Vṛndā wood for the Hallīçaka dance;
the dance is performed by Dāmodara, his friends, and the maidens, to the music of
the drum and to song. The advent of the demon Ariṣṭa is announced; Dāmodara bids the
maidens and herdsmen mount a hill, and watch the struggle. It proves unequal; the
bull demon recognizes the superiority of his foe, and that he is Viṣṇu himself, and
meets death with resignation. The victory accomplished, the news is brought of a new
danger, the snake Kāliya has appeared on the Yamunā bank, menacing cows and Brahmins.
Act IV shows us the maidens seeking to restrain Kṛṣṇa from the new struggle, but he
persists and overcomes the demon, plunging into the waters to grapple with him. He
brings him out, learns that he had entered the waters in fear of Garuḍa <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>who slays snakes at pleasure, makes him promise to spare cows and Brahmins, and puts
on him a mark that Garuḍa must respect. A herald then enters to challenge Dāmodara
and his brother Balarāma to the festival of the boys at Mathurā.
</p>
<p>Act V shows us Kaṅsa plotting the overthrow of the youths. A herald reports the arrival
of Dāmodara, and his great feats of strength, the mocking of the elephant let loose
on him, the making straight of a female dwarf, the breaking of the bow of the guardsman.
The king orders at once the boxing to begin; Kṛṣṇa, however, easily overcomes Muṣṭika
and Cāṇūra, the king’s chosen champions, and completes his victory by a sudden onslaught
which leaves the king dead. His soldiers would avenge him, but Vasudeva announces
Kṛṣṇa’s identity with Viṣṇu, and appoints Ugrasena king in Kaṅsa’s place, freeing
him from the confinement in which his son had placed him. Nārada with Apsarases and
Gandharvas appears to glorify Kṛṣṇa, who graciously permits Nārada to return to heaven,
and a benediction, spoken apparently by the actor, closes the play.
</p>
<p>The precise source of the drama is unknown; it differs in detail widely from the stories
of Kṛṣṇa in the <i>Harivaṅça</i>, <i>Viṣṇu</i>, and <i>Bhāgavata Purāṇas</i>, but none of these works, as we have it, is probably older than Bhāsa. The erotic
element, which is so closely associated with Kṛṣṇa in later tradition, is lacking
here as in the <i>Harivaṅça</i> and the <i>Viṣṇu Purāṇa</i>, and similarly the figure of Rādhā is missing.
</p>
<p>The merits of the <i>Bālacarita</i> are not reproduced in Bhāsa’s treatment of the other chief Avatāra of Viṣṇu. The
<i>Pratimānāṭaka</i> shows us the death of Daçaratha, when he realizes the departure of Rāma, deprived
of his inheritance by Kaikeyī’s wiles, with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa into the forest; his
statue is added to those of his predecessors in the statue (<i>pratimā</i>) hall. Bharata returns from a visit, learns of the news, pursues Rāma, but is induced
to return to rule, bearing with him Rāma’s shoes as token that he regards himself
but as viceroy. Rāma decides to offer the sacrifice for the dead for his sire; Rāvaṇa
appears under the guise of an expert, and bids him offer a golden antelope, by this
device securing Rāma’s absence when Sītā is stolen by him, slaying Jaṭāyu who seeks
to protect her. Rāma goes to Kiṣkindhā, and makes alliance with Sugrīva against Vālin.
Bharata <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>learns that Kaikeyī’s ruse had been induced by the curse of an ascetic, whose son
Daçaratha had unwittingly slain, and that she had but meant to ask for a banishment
of fourteen days, but had by a slip said years. He sends his army to aid Rāma, who
ultimately defeats Rāvaṇa, and recovers Sītā. He brings her with him to Janasthāna,
where he is begged to resume his kingdom; all then go by the magic car Puṣpak to Ayodhyā.
The seven acts of the play are matched by the six of the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n101.1src" href="#n101.1">13</a> the drama of the consecration of Rāma which follows, like its predecessor, the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>. It tells of Vālin’s death at the hands of Rāma; Hanumant’s success in reaching Lan̄kā
and in comforting Sītā and affronting Rāvaṇa. Vibhīṣaṇa advises the coercion of the
ocean to attain a passage for the army; Rāvaṇa vainly seeks to win Sītā, showing her
in appearance the heads of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, but she repudiates his advances; he
is compelled to fight, and the play ends with Rāma’s coronation. The epic apparently
has weighed too heavily on the author, whose resource in incident is remarkable by
its absence.
</p>
<p>A far more favourable opportunity is afforded to Bhāsa when he derived his story from
the Kathā literature,<a class="noteRef" id="n101.2src" href="#n101.2">14</a> as is doubtless the case in the <i>Avimāraka</i>, a drama in six acts. The daughter of king Kuntibhoja, the young Kuran̄gī, is saved
from an elephant by an unknown youth, who, in reality son of the Sauvīra king, is
with his father living as a member of a degraded caste for a year, as the outcome
of a curse. His low status forbids his aspiring to the princess, but love triumphs,
and the maidens of Kuran̄g, arrange a secret meeting to which the youth comes in the
guise of a thief. But the news leaks out and he must fly; in despair of reunion he
seeks death in the fire, but Agni repulses him; he would have thrown himself from
a rock, but a Vidyādhara dissuades him, giving him a ring which enables him unseen
to re-enter the palace and save Kuran̄gī, likewise desolated, from suicide. The way
for a happy issue from the impasse is found by the fact that Nārada reveals the true
history of Avimāraka; he is not in fact the son of the Sauvīra king; he is the son
of the god Agni by Sudarçanā, the wife of the king of Kāçi, who <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>gave him over on his birth to Sucetanā, her sister, wife of the Sauvīra king. The
marriage thus takes place with the approval of all those connected with the pair.
</p>
<p>Equally from the Kathā literature, and in this case from a source known to us, the
<i>Bṛhatkathā</i> of Guṇāḍhya, which, written in Paiçācī Prākrit has vanished, but is preserved in
a version from Nepal and two from Kashmir, is the subject of the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n102.1src" href="#n102.1">15</a> styled in the prologue a Prakaraṇa, which has four Acts and resembles in part that
form of drama as recognized by the theory, though its hero is the minister of Udayana,
the Vatsa king. The latter goes on an elephant hunt, armed with his lyre to charm
his prey, but is taken prisoner by a clever trick of his enemy, Pradyota Mahāsena,
of Ujjayinī, a counterfeit elephant being employed for his overthrow. Yaugandharāyaṇa
determines to revenge the king. In Ujjayinī Mahāsena discusses with his wife the question
of the marriage of their daughter Vāsavadattā, when the news of the capture of Udayana
arrives. They decide that she shall take lessons in music from the captive, and, not
unnaturally, the two fall in love. Yaugandharāyaṇa comes to Ujjayinī in disguise with
his friends, and through his machinations the king is enabled to escape with Vāsavadattā,
though the minister is himself, after a gallant fight, captured. Mahāsena, however,
appreciated the minister’s cleverness, and has the marriage of the pair depicted.<a class="noteRef" id="n102.2src" href="#n102.2">16</a>
</p>
<p>The play is criticized severely, though not by name, by Bhāmaha,<a class="noteRef" id="n102.3src" href="#n102.3">17</a> on the score that Udayana could never have been deceived by an artificial elephant,
and if deceived his life would not have been spared by the enemy forces. The contentions
are obviously of little value in this form; the essence, of course, is that such an
incident which may pass in a tale seems too childish for a drama, but, if this troubles
us, we may console ourselves with the reflexion that the trees were thick, and Udayana
ardent in the chase. Vāmana<a class="noteRef" id="n102.4src" href="#n102.4">18</a> cites the end of verse 3 in Act IV which occurs also in the <i>Arthaçāstra</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n102.5src" href="#n102.5">19</a> a work which need not be older than Bhāsa, and may be a good deal later.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n103.1src" href="#n103.1">20</a> or the <i>Svapnanāṭaka</i>, in six Acts forms in substance the continuation of the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>. The minister is anxious to secure for Udayana an extension of his power by wedding
him to Padmāvatī, daughter of the king of Magadha. But Udayana will not leave his
beloved Vāsavadattā, so that strategy is needed. The minister induces Vāsavadattā
to aid in his scheme, and, taking advantage of a temporary separation, he spreads
the rumour that the queen and he have perished in a conflagration. The king is thus
induced to consider marriage with Padmāvatī, in whose care the minister has entrusted
the queen, giving out that she is his sister. Padmāvatī is willing to accept the love
of the king, but, learning that he has never ceased to cherish the memory of his beloved,
she is seized by a severe headache, and the king comes to comfort her. He does not
find her, and lies down, sleep overcoming him; Vāsavadattā who had come to aid Padmāvatī
sits down beside the sleeping form which she mistakes for that of her new mistress,
but, as he begins to speak in his sleep she rises and leaves him, but not before he
has caught a glimpse of her, in a dream as he thinks. He is summoned to the palace,
and finds the good news that his foes have been defeated, and a messenger has come
from Mahāsena and his wife to console him, bearing the picture of the nuptials of
himself and Vāsavadattā. Padmāvatī recognizes in the lady the features of the sister
left in her care by Yaugandharāyaṇa, who arrives to explain to the satisfaction of
all the plan he has devised to secure Udayana’s ends.
</p>
<p>The fame of the work in Rājaçekhara’s time is attested, and already before him the
imaginary conflagration of the queen had excited the imitation of Harṣa in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>; Vāmana<a class="noteRef" id="n103.2src" href="#n103.2">21</a> cites from it, and Abhinavagupta<a class="noteRef" id="n103.3src" href="#n103.3">22</a> knew it. Nor is there any doubt that it is the poet’s masterpiece and the most mature
of his dramas. Great promise, however, in a different vein is shown in the <i>Cārudatta</i>, of which we have only a fragment in four <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>Acts without beginning or final verses. Cārudatta, a merchant whose generosity has
impoverished him, has seen a hetaera Vasantasenā at a festival, and they have fallen
in love. Pursued by the king’s brother-in-law, Saṁsthāna, Vasantasenā takes refuge
in Cārudatta’s house, and, when she goes, she leaves in his care her gold ornaments.
She generously ransoms from his creditors a former servant of Cārudatta, who then
renounces the world and becomes a monk. In the night the ornaments, which she had
deposited, are stolen by a thief Sajjalaka who breaks into Cārudatta’s house, in order
to gain the means to purchase the freedom of a slave of the hetaera with whom he is
in love. Cārudatta is overcome with shame at learning of the theft of goods deposited
in his care, and his noble wife sacrifices a pearl necklace, which she gives to the
Vidūṣaka to hand over to Vasantasenā in lieu of her lost jewels. He takes it to the
hetaera, who has learned of the theft, but accepts it to have the excuse of visiting
the merchant once more. She therefore hands over the slave girl to Sajjalaka, and
starts out to Cārudatta’s house. At this point the play ends abruptly, but it seems
as if Cārudatta were accused of theft, and that Vasantasenā herself is in grave danger
of her life.
</p>
<p>A verse of this play is cited by Vāmana<a class="noteRef" id="n104.1src" href="#n104.1">23</a> and another,<a class="noteRef" id="n104.2src" href="#n104.2">24</a> found also in the <i>Bālacarita</i><a class="noteRef" id="n104.3src" href="#n104.3">25</a> and the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n104.4src" href="#n104.4">26</a> is quoted by Daṇḍin in the <i>Kāvyādarça</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n104.5src" href="#n104.5">27</a> We need not doubt that Bhāsa is his source, especially as there is possibly elsewhere
in the <i>Kāvyādarça</i> an allusion to the dream scene of the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> and its sequel. The <i>Daridracārudatta</i> mentioned by Abhinavagupta is most probably the same work. From it are derived the
first four Acts of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n104.6src" href="#n104.6">28</a> The source of the drama is not certain; we have the motif of the love of a merchant
and a hetaera elsewhere, but not with the special developments given by Bhāsa.
</p>
<p>Verses attributed to Bhāsa are also found which are not contained in the extant dramas,
so that, even allowing for misquotation and confusion, it is probable that he may
have written <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>further plays, or he may have illustrated the book of the dramatic art which he is
credited with writing,<a class="noteRef" id="n105.1src" href="#n105.1">29</a> by inserting examples of his own composition. Why his plays should have fared so
badly as to disappear from popular use apparently for centuries does not appear. The
most plausible view is that he was a poet of the south, and that his dramas suffered
from the general Mahomedan objection to everything Hindu, and especially to the dramas
of an earnest devotee of Viṣṇu such as Bhāsa was. But this is mere conjecture.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>Bhāsa’s Art and Technique</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The number of Bhāsa’s dramas, and the variety of their themes, indicate the activity
and originality of his talent. Even the limitations imposed by the choice of epic
subjects are often successfully surmounted. In the Rāma dramas only is there lacking
any sign of his ability; the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i> is a somewhat dreary summary of the corresponding books (IV–VI) of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, nor is the <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i> substantially superior. The variations are in the main few and unimportant; the two
struggles between Sugrīva and Vālin are condensed into one, which leaves the treacherous
slaying of Vālin without shadow of excuse, and casts a blemish on Rāma’s character
which later dramatists avoid. The pathetic scene of the epic in which Tārā, his wife,
laments Vālin’s death is omitted, Vālin forbidding any woman to gaze on him in his
fall. The two efforts of Rāvaṇa to deceive Sītā, first by showing her Rāma’s head,
and later Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa bound and seemingly dead, are reduced to one, the showing
of the heads of both, and Sītā’s constancy is made inhuman by denying her the comfort
of a consoler. To secure a happy ending, Agni is made to vindicate Sītā by the test
of fire, and to hand her over to Rāma as Lakṣmī and his fit mate. The characters remain
stereotyped and dull; Rāvaṇa is nothing more than a <i lang="la">miles gloriosus</i>, if not comic, and Lakṣmaṇa cuts a very poor figure.<a class="noteRef" id="n105.2src" href="#n105.2">30</a>

<p>The pieces based on the <i>Mahābhārata</i> shows more invention <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>and interest. The <i>Madhyamavyāyoga</i> exploits neatly the theme of Hiḍimbā’s longing to see her husband of many years before,
and the obedience of a son to a mother exemplified both by Ghaṭotkaca and by Madhyama;
a mother’s bidding outweighs even that of a father. The struggle of father against
son, both unknowing, is original, though not tragic. In the <i>Karṇabhāra</i> the nobility of the haughty Karṇa is emphasized; in the epic he surrenders his armour
to Indra, but demands a price, the lance that never fails; in the play it suffices
the prince that he has conferred a boon on the god himself. There is the same martial
spirit, evoking the sentiment of heroism in the audience, in the <i>Dūtaghaṭotkaca</i> where the joy of the Kurus is contrasted effectively with the doubts of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
and the grave warning which Ghaṭotkaca brings of the revenge to be wreaked by Arjuna
for his son’s death. The <i>Dūtavākya</i> is admirable in his contrast between the character of Duryodhana and the majesty
of Kṛṣṇa; the picture motif is effectively elaborated, and the deep admiration of
the poet for Kṛṣṇa as the embodiment of the highest of gods Viṣṇu, of whom he was
an adorer, is plainly manifest. In the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i> Duryodhana’s hauteur to the highest of gods meets with its just punishment; Duryodhana
is the chief subject, but not the hero, of the piece which manifests the just<a class="noteRef" id="n106.1src" href="#n106.1">31</a> punishment of the impious. The death of Duryodhana is admirably depicted; his child
who loved to sit on his knees comes to him, but must be repulsed; the touch that brought
joy aforetime would now be an agony.<a class="noteRef" id="n106.2src" href="#n106.2">32</a> But Duryodhana, with all his demerits as a man, remains heroic in his death.
</p>
<p>The <i>Bālacarita</i> reveals the originality of Bhāsa’s genius; the entr’acte to the second Act is extremely
effective in its terrors, and the poet has no hesitation in asking the audience to
conceive for themselves the strange figures of the attendants of Viṣṇu or the host
of the goddess Kārtyāyanī, or the bull Ariṣṭa, or the snake demon Kāliya, all of whom
appear on the stage, but doubtless in costumes which left most to the mind’s eye.
The miracles of the light emanating from the child Kṛṣṇa, the crossing of the Yamunā,
and the water springing from the ground, are innovations on the tradition, as is the
apparent death and revival of the child of Yaçodā. Kṛṣṇa is heroism incarnate, Kaṅsa
<span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>without merit, and his slaying just, but the heroic sentiment is blended with the
erotic, and with that of wonder. As a drama, however, the play suffers unquestionably
from the wholly undeniable disparity between the two opponents; Kṛṣṇa is never in
danger, and his feats are too easily achieved to produce their full effect.
</p>
<p>The <i>Avimāraka</i> is a drama of love, primitive in its expression and intensity; Bhāsa’s love for rapid
action is here, as always, strongly marked, as is also his willingness to repeat incidents
and situations; the hero twice seeks suicide, and the heroine does so once. The dénouement
is artificial, though something of the kind was necessary to secure the possibility
of the marriage of the pair. There is a far more interesting hint of youthful love
in the amours of Udayana and Vāsavadattā in the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>, where the rapidity of action is in entire harmony with the skill attributed to the
minister, whose address, courage, and loyalty, make him an attractive figure. The
<i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> itself reveals Udayana as a faithful and devoted husband, very different from the
careless if courteous gentleman of Harṣa’s dramas. His love for the queen he imagines
lost ennobles and elevates his character, while motives of statecraft and the affection
shown him by Padmāvatī easily explain his wooing of that maiden. Vāsavadattā herself
is not the jealous if high-minded wife of Harṣa’s plays; she is the devoted and self-sacrificing
lover who is willing to postpone her own feelings and wishes to the good of her husband.
The king and queen are the finest products of Bhāsa’s characterization of lovers.
In the <i>Cārudatta</i>, however, we have clever studies in the hetaera, the merchant and the minor figures,
though the value of the play must seem less to us than when completed and elaborated
in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>.
</p>
<p>Bhāsa undoubtedly excels in suggesting heroism; this characteristic is admirably depicted
in Yaugandharāyaṇa, and above all in Duryodhana, who <span class="corr" id="xd32e4512" title="Source: is">in</span> the <i>Dūtaghaṭotkaca</i> effectively replies to the menaces of the envoy by promising an answer in deeds<span class="corr" id="xd32e4517" title="Not in source">,</span> war, not in harsh words. But his power is not confined to heroism, love, pathos,
or the marvellous. The Vidūṣaka in his hands attains the characteristics which mark
him in the later drama, and, though much was doubtless traditional, it may <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>safely be assumed that he tended by his example to stereotype the figure. In the <i>Avimāraka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n108.1src" href="#n108.1">33</a> he distinguishes himself by devotion to his master; he is set on finding him, dead
or alive, when he is missing, and he is prepared if need be to follow him beyond the
grave. Avimāraka himself portrays the character of his friend; he places first, doubtless
deliberately, the amusement he produces in social intercourse (<i>goṣṭhīṣu hāsyaḥ</i>), but he describes him also as brave in battle, a wise friend, a comforter in sorrow,
a violent foe to his enemies. If in the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n108.2src" href="#n108.2">34</a> he seems to abandon the idea of succouring his master, it is only because he is convinced
<span class="corr" id="xd32e4532" title="Source: thst">that</span> Vatsa is dead, and that nothing can be done to save him. The other side of his character
is his devotion to the pleasures of the table and his feeble attempts at wit and humour.
Vāsavadattā he remembers fondly because she used to see that he never lacked sweetmeats.<a class="noteRef" id="n108.3src" href="#n108.3">35</a> When in the <i>Avimāraka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n108.4src" href="#n108.4">36</a> the heroine weeps in love-sorrow, he would like to weep also in sympathy; but no
tears come, and he recalls that, even when his own father died, he could hardly weep.
When addressed as a man, he insists that he is a woman. He is, however, a Brahmin
in his prejudices; he will not drink brandy, a pleasure which he permits to the Gātrasevaka,
the disguise assumed by one of Yaugandharāyaṇa’s following in the attempt to rescue
Udayana. This worthy favours us with a eulogy of drink, which is an interesting fragment
of the drinking songs which must have existed in ancient India:<a class="noteRef" id="n108.5src" href="#n108.5">37</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>dhaṇṇā surāhi mattā dhaṇṇā surāhi aṇulittā;</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>dhaṇṇā surāhi hṇādā dhaṇṇā surāhi saṁñavidā.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Blessed those that are drunk with drink, blessed those that are soaked with drink;
blessed those that are washed with drink, blessed those that are choked with drink.’
Amusing also is the figure of Yaugandharāyaṇa as an Unmattaka, devoted to eating and
dancing, and of Rumaṇvant in his guise of a Çramaṇaka. There is genuine humour in
the scene in the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n108.6src" href="#n108.6">38</a> between the Gātrasevaka and the servant, when the former makes ready the elephant
Bhadravatī, which is to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>the means of carrying off the king and Vāsavadattā beyond the reach of all pursuit,
without raising any suspicion on the part of the entourage of Mahāsena. Quiet humour
is shown in the episode of the bringing of Bhīma by Ghaṭotkaca to his mother Hiḍimbā;
Ghaṭotkaca has difficulty in describing his victim, and is much amazed to find his
mother, whose curiosity is aroused by his lack of precision, finding him to be his
deity and hers in his capacity as husband and father.<a class="noteRef" id="n109.1src" href="#n109.1">39</a> In the same vein is the compliment paid by Rāma to Sītā, when the latter accurately
predicts the action he would take when his father offered him the throne: ‘Thou hast
guessed well; few pairs are there of like character in the world (<i lang="und">suṣṭhu tarkitam alpaṁ tulyaçīlāni dvandvāni sṛjyante</i>)’.<a class="noteRef" id="n109.2src" href="#n109.2">40</a> Quite distinctly amusing is the scene at the close of the <i>Avimāraka</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n109.3src" href="#n109.3">41</a> where the facts of the relationships are being disclosed to the king Kuntibhoja.
That sovereign may be justly excused his difficulty in apprehending the situation;
he is reduced to such confusion that he is dubious about his own capital Vairantya,
but finally, when assured that the hero is the son-in-law of Kuntibhoja, asks who
that worthy may be, to be reminded politely that he himself is Kuntibhoja, father
of Kuran̄gī, son of Duryodhana, and lord of Vairantya. This power explains the description
of Bhāsa as the laughter (<i lang="und">hāsa</i>) of poetry given to him by Jayadeva in the <i>Prasannarāghava</i>, a title which is also merited by such verses as one cited in the anthologies,<a class="noteRef" id="n109.4src" href="#n109.4">42</a> though not found in the extant dramas:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>kapāle mārjāraḥ paya iti karāṅl leḍhi çaçinas</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>tarucchidraprotān bisam iti karī saṁkalayati</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>ratānte talpasthān harati vanitāpy aṅçukam iti</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>prabhāmattaç candro jagad idam aho viplavayati.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘When its rays fall on its cheeks the cat licks them, thinking them milk; when they
are caught in the cleft of a tree the elephant deems them a lotus; when they rest
on the couch of lovers the maiden seizes them, saying, “’Tis my robe”; the moon in
truth, proud of its brilliance, doth lead astray all this world.’
</p>
<p>Of deeper sentiments we need expect nothing from Bhāsa; <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>in this respect he sets the model for his successors. From Kālidāsa he differs in
being a devotee of Viṣṇu rather than Çiva, but he is equally an admirer of the established
Brahminical order. In the <i>Pañcarātra</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n110.1src" href="#n110.1">43</a> the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n110.2src" href="#n110.2">44</a> and in the character of Nārada in the <i>Avimāraka</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n110.3src" href="#n110.3">45</a> we find clearly expressed his appreciation of the high rank of the Brahmin, and the
obligations due to him from kings and other classes.
</p>
<p>Care in the delineation of even minor characters is normally displayed; the number
of these is considerable; sixteen each in the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> and the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>, about twenty in the <i>Avimāraka</i>, <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i>, and <i>Pañcarātra</i>, twelve in the <i>Cārudatta</i>, and about thirty in the <i>Bālacarita</i>. But there are traces of the anxiety of Bhāsa to avoid adding needlessly to the number
of those appearing; in the <i>Avimāraka</i> neither the king of Kāçi nor Sucetanā appears on the scene despite their part in
the play. The silence of Sītā, though at the close of the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i> she appears on the stage, is doubtless explicable by the same dramatic touch which
makes Euripides refuse to assign any words to Alkestis on her return from the dead.
</p>
<p>In technique Bhāsa does not accord entirely with the later rules of the theorists.
The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, it is true, when it forbids the exhibition of battle scenes contradicts itself,
and Bhāsa freely permits them, as must have been the case in the primitive drama in
which Kṛṣṇa slew Kaṅsa. The maidens, however, he bids watch the mortal combat of Ariṣṭa
and Kṛṣṇa from afar. Daçaratha’s death he admits; the bodies of Cāṇūra, Muṣṭika, and
Kaṅsa lie on the stage, and Vālin perishes there as well as Duryodhana, but all these
are evildoers, and their death evokes no sorrow. The same simplicity doubtless accounts
for the introduction of the mythological figures of the <i>Bālacarita</i>, whom we need not imagine to have been elaborately costumed; they announce their
nature or are described,<a class="noteRef" id="n110.4src" href="#n110.4">46</a> and the spectator supplies the imagination requisite to comprehend them.
</p>
<p>We find already in Bhāsa the formal distinction of introductory scenes into Viṣkambhakas
of two kinds, according as Sanskrit alone or Sanskrit and Prākrit are used and Praveçakas;
<span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>in the former the number of interlocutors is three in two<a class="noteRef" id="n111.1src" href="#n111.1">47</a> cases against one or two as usual later; there are other signs of his fondness for
triads.<a class="noteRef" id="n111.2src" href="#n111.2">48</a> The introduction normally is styled Sthāpanā,<a class="noteRef" id="n111.3src" href="#n111.3">49</a> not as later Prastāvanā, and it is extremely simple; after a Nāndī, not preserved,
has been pronounced—perhaps behind the scene—the director enters, utters a benediction,
and is about to make an announcement when a sound is heard which leads up to the actual
drama. No mention of the poet’s name or the work is found, but these we may suggest
were left to the preliminaries which even in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> were elaborate, and which doubtless were performed before Bhāsa’s plays, as they
were essentially religious rites in honour of the gods. On the other hand, the close,
the Bharatavākya, of the later theory is varied in Bhāsa. The conventions as to the
use of speech, aloud, aside to another, or to the audience alone are well known, and
effective use is made of the voice from the air or behind the scene, as in the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i>, when Rāvaṇa taunts his prisoner and asks, who can set her free when her rescuers
are dead; the voice replies, ‘Rāma, Rāma’.<a class="noteRef" id="n111.4src" href="#n111.4">50</a>
</p>
<p>There are unquestionably primitive traits in Bhāsa’s art; he uses with dangerous freedom
the device by which some one departs and returns straightway, to narrate what must
have taken long to happen; thus in the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i>, Çan̄kukarṇa is bidden send a thousand men against Hanumant; he departs at once,
to return and tell that they have fallen. Free use is made also, as in the epic, of
magic weapons in the conflict, as in the battle of Duryodhana and Kṛṣṇa in the <i>Dūtavākya</i>. So also in the <i>Madhyamavyāyoga</i> we find Ghaṭotkaca employing his magic power to produce water from a rock; then he
binds Bhīma in a magic noose, from which he is delivered by a magic formula. In the
<i>Dūtavākya</i> the discus of Kṛṣṇa <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>secures water from the heavenly Ganges by magic means; it has the power to move the
mountains of the gods, to set the ocean in motion, and to bring down the stars to
earth, ideas which are less unintelligible when we remember the wide-spread Indian
beliefs in the powers of magicians, which we find later in Harṣa’s <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, and which are earlier recorded of those who have attained high degrees of intuition
in both the Upaniṣads and Buddhism. In the <i>Avimāraka</i> we have the magic ring of the Vidyādhara playing a decisive part in the action, since
by its use the hero can enter unseen the harem and visit his wife Kuran̄gī in secret.
It is clear that both in the epic and in the popular tale Bhāsa found adequate precedent
for the stress laid on these means of evoking in his audience the sentiment of wonder.
</p>
<p>The use of the dance as an ornament to the drama which is seen in Kālidāsa is frequently
resorted to in Bhāsa. In Act III of the <i>Bālacarita</i> there is a performance of the Hallīçaka dance, in which both the herdsmen and the
cowherdesses take full part; the dance is accompanied by music and song, and the maidens
are gaily attired. A similar dance is mentioned in Act II of the <i>Pañcarātra</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n112.1src" href="#n112.1">51</a> a reflex no doubt of the ritual dance of the winter solstice in the Mahāvrata rite.
It is conceivable also that the conception in the <i>Bālacarita</i> of the appearance of Viṣṇu’s weapons as figures on the stage in the dress of herdsmen
is a reminiscence of a cult dance in honour of Viṣṇu, but this idea must not be pressed
unduly, for the poet there invents also the figures of the Curse and the King’s Fortune
as <i lang="la">personae dramatis</i>. There is, it is clear, a certain similarity between the personification of these
abstractions and the allegorical figures of the Buddhist drama, which come again into
being in the <i>Prabodhacandrodaya</i> of Kṛṣṇamiçra. Song as an important element in the drama again appears in the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i>, where the Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the praises of Viṣṇu.<a class="noteRef" id="n112.2src" href="#n112.2">52</a>
</p>
<p>There are clear traces in the dramas of the overwhelming influence of epic tradition
and of epic recitation in the tendency <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>to introduce the description of battle scenes at great length in lieu of dramatic
action, while a certain lack of skill is apparent in the attempt to transform the
tale into a drama. Thus in the <i>Avimāraka</i> the facts essential for a full understanding of the story come out only in the last
Act, and the adventures of the hero are there recounted with distinct lack of propriety,
as they have formed the subject of the earlier acts of the drama. Neither the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i> nor the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> is constructed in so clumsy a manner, but in both cases the working out of the plot
is certainly open to criticism. Thus even in the last Act of the latter drama, which
in many respects is effective, the stage directions assume that the queen appears
on the stage with Vāsavadattā as her attendant, but that the king either does not
see, or does not recognize the latter, both obviously very improbable suppositions;
possibly it is assumed that the presence of Vāsavadattā, though obvious to the audience,
is concealed from the king in some manner by the use of the curtain, but this is left
to be imagined,<a class="noteRef" id="n113.1src" href="#n113.1">53</a> and it would have been much simpler to invent some ground for securing the entry
of Vāsavadattā by herself later on. On the other hand, in Act I of the play, the facts
regarding the supposed death of Vāsavadattā and the minister in a fire are effectively
brought out by the device of using a Brahmacārin, who arrives at the hermitage at
the same time as Yaugandharāyaṇa and Vāsavadattā in their disguise, and tells the
tale of the disaster as explaining why he has left that place in sorrow at the event,
dilating at the same time on the effect of the news on the unhappy king. The mode
in which Vāsavadattā in Act V mistakes the king for Padmāvatī is quite naturally evolved,
for the place where he is resting is poorly illuminated and she was naturally unwilling
to arouse her mistress from the slumber into which she hoped she had fallen. In Act
II of the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i> the conversation of Hanumant with Sītā is made possible only by the somewhat implausible
device of assuming that the Rākṣasīs who guard her fall asleep at their post.
</p>
<p>A rather marked fondness is shown by Bhāsa for the repetition of the same incident.
Thus in the <i>Avimāraka</i> we have the <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>twice repeated attempt of the hero at suicide followed by the attempt of the heroine
in the same sense, from which he saves her. At the close of the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i> we have again the idea of the attempted suicide of the heroine’s mother, which is
obviated by the king’s good sense in showing her that the marriage of the runaway
pair was quite proper in their rank and in arranging for marrying them in a painting.
The dying Vālin in the <i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i> has a vision of the Ganges and the other great rivers. Urvaçī and the Apsarases,
and the chariot drawn by a thousand swans, which bears away the dead, coming for his
spirit; Duryodhana in the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i> has a similar vision, and Avimāraka, when on the point of committing suicide he sees
the Vidyādhara beside him, imagines that this is a vision such as comes often to dying
men. Again in the prologues there is almost a monotonous adoption of the device by
which the director is interrupted in making a proposed announcement by a voice from
behind the scene, which enables him by a clever transition to lead the audience into
the dramatic action proper.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> <i>Bhāsa’s Style</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The rapidity and directness of the action of Bhāsa’s plays is reflected in his style.
More than any other dramatist, he uses the verse to further the progress of the play,
in lieu of devoting it to descriptions rather poetic than directly aiding the drama,
and it is characteristic that he freely employs monostichs, which are rare later.
On the other hand, he is ready to resort to monologue; that on the third Act of the
<i>Avimāraka</i> suggested perhaps the monologue of Çarvilaka in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, whose author must have known Bhāsa’s works intimately.
</p>
<p>The dominating influence on Bhāsa’s style was clearly that of the epic and in special
of Vālmīki, whose great work inevitably impressed itself on the minds of all his successors.
The effects are visible not merely in the dramas with epic subject-matter, but extend
throughout Bhāsa’s plays. The results of this influence are all to the good; the necessities
of the drama saved Bhāsa from the one great defect of the epic style, the lack of
measure, which permits the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> to illustrate by twenty-nine similes the sorrows of Sītā in her captivity, while
in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span><i>Abhiṣekanāṭaka</i> the dramatist is content with one. On the other hand he owes to it the relative simplicity
of his diction, and his freedom from the excesses of the poetic equivalent of the
nominal style, which comes to dominate later Sanskrit literature. The use of long
compounds is obviously and plainly undramatic; carried to excess it must have rendered
a Sanskrit drama unintelligible even to a highly cultivated audience as far as the
verses were concerned, and it is an essential dramatic merit in Bhāsa that his expression
is far easier to follow than in much of later dramatic poetry. He possesses in fact
that clearness, which is theoretically a merit of the Kāvya style, but which is signally
neglected by the average Kāvya writer in his anxiety to display the complete familiarity
which he possesses with every side of the art of poetry. As far as we can judge from
the scanty fragments of Açvaghoṣa’s dramas, that poet was more complex than Bhāsa,
and certainly so in his epics, which aided powerfully in the formation of Kālidāsa’s
epic and dramatic style.
</p>
<p>Bhāsa, of course, is not in the slightest degree akin to a poet of the people; he
is an accomplished master of the art of poetry, but one whose good sense and taste
preserve him from adopting in drama the artifices which are permitted in the court
epic and lyric which were intended to be studied at leisure. The simple and sententious
is beloved of Bhāsa: thus Karṇa repels the objections of Çalya to his parting with
armour and earring to the disguised Indra:<a class="noteRef" id="n115.1src" href="#n115.1">54</a>

<p>The simple figures of speech are freely used by Bhāsa, and he shows as usual a marked
fondness for the accumulation of similar sounds, as in <i>sajalajaladhara</i>, <i>sanīranīrada</i>, or <i>kuladayaṁ hanti <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>madena nārī</i>: <i>kūladvayaṁ kṣubdhajalā nadīva</i>.

<p>Bhāsa is fond of expressing typical feelings in simple language which later poets
would deem lacking in ornament; thus he expresses a mother’s feelings regarding her

<p>A characteristic of Bhāsa is his fondness for pithy proverbial phrases, ‘Everything
suits a handsome figure’, ‘Misfortunes never come singly’, ‘Good news sounds more
pleasant from a friend’s mouth<span class="corr" id="xd32e5123" title="Not in source">’</span> (<i lang="und">piaṇivediamāṇāṇi piāṇi piadarāṇi honti</i>), ‘Man’s fate is as mobile as an elephant’s trunk’, ‘There are many obstacles in
the road to fortune’, ‘A small cause begets grave misfortune’, are found in the <i>Avimāraka</i> alone. An idea once expressed fascinates Bhāsa and is repeated again and again in
the same terms, a fact which incidentally helps to assure the genuineness of the plays.
For some phrases he has a special fondness; <i>mā</i> with the instrumental is normal in lieu of the ordinary <i>alam</i>, which he also uses; <i lang="und">aho tu khalu</i> to introduce a stanza; <i lang="und">kiṁ nu khalu</i> in a question; <i lang="und">āma</i> and <i lang="und">bādham</i> to indicate assent; <i lang="und">sukham āryasya</i> as a phrase of greeting. Especially is he devoted to the term <i lang="und">vara</i>, sometimes before, usually after, the noun whose quality it intensifies; the use
occurs even twice or thrice in a single stanza.
</p>
<p>The harmony and melody of Bhāsa’s style, added to its purity and perspicuity, have
no better proof than the imitations of his verses which are unquestionably to be traced
in Kālidāsa, who attests thus his practical appreciation of the merits of the dramatist,
with whose established fame his nascent genius had to contend.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">6.</span> <i>The Language of the Plays</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bhāsa’s Sanskrit<a class="noteRef" id="n120.2src" href="#n120.2">77</a> is in the main correct according to the rules of the grammarians, but his dependence
on the epic is revealed by the occasional use of epic irregularities, almost always
for the sake of the metre, which in the epic also is the cause of many deviations
from classical grammar. We have thus the irregular contractions <i>putreti</i> and <i>Avantyādhipateḥ</i>, and a number of middle forms in lieu of active, <i>gamiṣye</i>, <i>garjase</i>, <i>drakṣyate</i>, <i>pṛcchase</i>, <i>bhraçyate</i>, <i>ruhyate</i>, <i>çroṣyate</i>. In other cases the active replaces the middle, <i>āpṛccha</i>, <i>upalapsyati</i>, <i>pariṣvaja</i>. There is confusion between the simple and the causative verb in <i>sravati</i> and <i>vījanti</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>and in <i>vimoktukāma</i>. The forms <i>rudantī</i> and <i>gṛhya</i> have many epic parallels. Irregular compounds are <i>sarvarājñaḥ</i> in verse, and <i>Kāçirājñe</i> in prose; <i>vyūḍhoras</i> and <i>tulyadharma</i> occur in verse. The use in one clause of both <i>ced</i> and <i>yadi</i> is found in verse and also in prose, as in the epic. Mere blunders perhaps may be
styled <i>pratyāyati</i>, a haplological form of the causative with the meaning of the simple verb, <i>samāçvāsitum</i> with causative sense, and <i>yudh</i> as a masculine noun. There are other seeming irregularities, but they are either
sanctioned by usage or possible of explanation by reference to variant interpretations
of Pāṇini’s rules.
</p>
<p>The Prākrits<a class="noteRef" id="n121.1src" href="#n121.1">78</a> found in Bhāsa are normally Çaurasenī, which is present in all the plays save the
<i>Dūtavākya</i>, which has no Prākrit; Māgadhī found in two different forms; and what may be styled
Ardha-Māgadhī. The distinctive feature of his language is its transitional aspect
as compared with Açvaghoṣa on the one hand and Kālidāsa on the other. Açvaghoṣa never
softens—save in one instance—hard consonants, but both <i>ṭ</i> and <i>t</i> are changed to <i>ḍ</i> and <i>d</i> in Bhāsa. Açvaghoṣa never omits consonants, but, though this is less often carried
out than in Kālidāsa, we find cases of the loss of <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>y</i> when intervocalic. <i>y</i> itself suffers frequent change to <i>j</i>, contrary to Açvaghoṣa’s usage. The change of <i>n</i> initial and medial to <i>ṇ</i> is regular, while it is unknown to Açvaghoṣa. The aspirates <i>kh</i>, <i>gh</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>dh</i>, <i>ph</i>, and <i>bh</i> are all often reduced as later to <i>h</i>, but never in Açvaghoṣa.
</p>
<p>In the case of conjunct consonants we find that <i>jñ</i> gives in Bhāsa either <i>ññ</i> or <i>ṇṇ</i>, possibly the latter by error; Açvaghoṣa has <i>ññ</i> only, Kālidāsa <i>ṇṇ</i>. For <i>ny</i> and <i>ṇy</i> Bhāsa has always <i>ṇṇ</i> as against Açvaghoṣa’s <i>ññ</i>. The eliding of a consonant, with the compensatory lengthening of the vowel as in
<i>dīsadi</i>, is unknown to Açvaghoṣa, where the omission of the consonant twice occurs but without
lengthening; it is frequent in Bhāsa and regular in Kālidāsa. The analogous use of
a short vowel and a double consonant to represent a long vowel with a single consonant
is unknown to Açvaghoṣa, but Bhāsa has it in <i>evva</i>, <i>evvaṁ</i>, <i>jovvana</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span><i>devva</i>, <i>ekka</i>. On the other hand, like Açvaghoṣa, for <i>ry</i> he has <i>yy</i> only in lieu of Kālidāsa’s <i>jj</i>. For the later <i>metta matta</i> is always found, and the epenthetic vowel is <i>u</i>, not <i>i</i>, in <i>purusa</i>, and <i>puruva</i> is normal.
</p>
<p>In inflection we have, in the nominative and accusative plural of neuter stems in
<i>a</i>, <i>āni</i> in Açvaghoṣa, <i>āṇi</i> in Bhāsa, while both <i>āṇi</i> and <i>āiṁ</i> are allowed later. The accusative plural masculine has also, analogously to <i>āni</i> in the Ardha-Māgadhī of the Açoka inscriptions,<a class="noteRef" id="n122.1src" href="#n122.1">79</a> <i>āṇi</i>, and the locative singular feminine is in <i>āaṁ</i>, not as later <i>āe</i>. For the later <i>attāṇaaṁ</i> we have <i>attāṇaṁ</i>. For ‘we’ Açvaghoṣa has <i>vayaṁ</i>, Kālidāsa <i>amhe</i>; Bhāsa both and <i>vaaṁ</i>. In the genitive plural Bhāsa has both <i>amhāaṁ</i> and the only form later <i>amhāṇaṁ</i>, while Açvaghoṣa would doubtless have used <i>amhākaṁ</i>. <i>kissa</i> is kept for later <i>kīsa</i>, and <i>kocci</i> (<i>kaccid</i>) disappears later. The root <i>darç</i> is represented by <i>dass</i> and <i>daṅs</i>, <i>grah</i> by <i>gaṇhadi</i> against the later <i>geṇhadi</i>, which, however, is found in Açvaghoṣa. The older <span class="corr" id="xd32e5407" title="Source: form">forms</span> <i>karia</i> and <i>gacchia</i> or <i>gamia</i>, are found in lieu of <i>kadua</i> and <i>gadua</i>, but the last occurs once. <i>mā</i> is used with the gerund in the sense of <i>alam</i>.
</p>
<p>Many of these peculiarities mark also the Māgadhī, which appears in two slightly varied
forms, the first in the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i> and the <i>Cārudatta</i>, the second in the <i>Bālacarita</i> and the <i>Pañcarātra</i>; in the two latter we have <i>ṣ</i> and <i>o</i> for the <i>ç</i> and <i>e</i> of the former. As in Açvaghoṣa there is no trace of obedience to the rules of the
grammarians which require <i>sṭ</i> for Sanskrit <i>ṣṭh</i> or <i>ṣṭ</i>, <i>çc</i> for <i>cch</i>, <i>sk</i> or <i>ẖk</i> for <i>kṣ</i>. For ‘I’ we find <i>ahake</i>, which is an intermediate stage between Açvaghoṣa’s <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e5466" title="Source: ahakam">ahakaṁ</span></i> and the later <i>hage</i>. <i>ny</i> becomes <i>ṇṇ</i>, not <i>ññ</i>, and the use of <i>y</i> to denote a dropped consonant is not carried out.
</p>
<p>The only passages that can claim to be anything like Ardha-Māgadhī are the remarks
of Indra in disguise in the <i>Karṇabhāra</i>, where the characteristic signs, the use of <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>e</i>, are found; in the speeches of Muṣṭika and Cāṇūra in the <i>Bālacarita</i> we have the use of <i>l</i> and a locative in <i>ammi</i>. A single passage in the <i>Pañcarātra</i> suggests Māgadhī Apabhraṅça, but is probably corrupt.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">7.</span> <i>The Metres of the Dramas</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is characteristic of Bhāsa’s close dependence on the epic that his dramas should
show a far more frequent use of the Çloka, 436 out of 1,092 verses. No later writer
save Bhavabhūti in his Rāma dramas approaches this frequency, which, it must be noted,
is not confined to the epic plays, for the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i> has 26 Çlokas out of 57 verses. In some plays, it is true, such as the <i>Madhyamavyāyoga</i> or the <i>Pañcarātra</i>, long series of Çlokas suggest incomplete command of the dramatic art on Bhāsa’s
part, but his general preference is clearly an outcome of his desire for rapid movement
and simplicity; it is the later love for elaborate descriptions that encourages the
use of sonorous and complex metres. The Çlokas are remarkably regular in construction;
the diiambus in the second Pāda is insisted on rigidly; the Vipulās<a class="noteRef" id="n123.1src" href="#n123.1">80</a> are rare, the fourth is unknown, the second sporadic, the first twice as frequent
as the third, and the prior foot is rarely<a class="noteRef" id="n123.2src" href="#n123.2">81</a> ⏓ - ⏑ -. The sparing use of the irregular forms is doubtless due to the comparatively
small number of Çlokas used consecutively, which minimises the desire for change of
form.
</p>
<p>Of the more elaborate metres, in which each syllable has a fixed length, the favourite
is the Vasantatilaka, which occurs 179 times, while the Upajāti occurs 121 times.
Next comes the Çārdūlavikrīḍita (92), Mālinī (72), Puṣpitāgrā with the scheme ⏑ ⏑
⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ - ⏑ - - | ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ - ⏑ - - (66), Vaṅçasthā (35), Çālinī (2),
Çikhariṇī (19), and Praharṣiṇī (17). Other metres are purely sporadic; they include
the Sragdharā, Hariṇī, Vaiçvadevī,<a class="noteRef" id="n123.3src" href="#n123.3">82</a> Drutavilambita,<a class="noteRef" id="n123.4src" href="#n123.4">83</a> Pṛthvī,<a class="noteRef" id="n123.5src" href="#n123.5">84</a> and Bhujan̄gaprāyata,<a class="noteRef" id="n123.6src" href="#n123.6">85</a> while the Suvadanā occurs four times. There is one example of the Upagīti with 12
morae in the first and third Pādas, and 15 in the second and fourth, and one of the
<span class="corr" id="xd32e5538" title="Source: Vaitalīya">Vaitālīya</span> with 14 and 16 in the two sets respectively. There is also one example of the shortest
form of Daṇḍaka metre, with six short syllables followed by <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>seven amphimacers, while there is also one shorter metre with six amphimacers. The
rarity of the Āryā is remarkable; beside the one Upagīti, which is in Prākrit, there
are only eleven, <span class="corr" id="xd32e5544" title="Source: of of">of</span> which five are in Prākrit. Contrast the frequency of the Āryā in Kālidāsa where there
are 31 out of 163 in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, and 35 out of 96 in the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>.
</p>
<p>Generally the rules of classical prosody are faithfully observed; there is one hiatus
between Pādas and once Sandhi; in <i>niyatī</i> and <i>maulī</i>, as in <i>anūkarṣa</i>, the lengthening is probably metrical. The Çlokas <span class="corr" id="xd32e5559" title="Source: shows">show</span> a great fondness for epic tags, such as <i>acireṇaiva kālena</i>, <i>prasādaṁ kartum arhasi</i>, and <i>kampayann iva medinīm</i>. Especially frequent is the breaking up of a verse between different speakers or
by interruptions of one kind or another.

<p class="first">There is <i>prima facie</i> the probability that Kālidāsa should be strongly affected by a predecessor so illustrious
and of such varied achievement, and the probability is turned into certainty by the
numerous coincidences between the two writers.<a class="noteRef" id="n124.1src" href="#n124.1">86</a> Inevitably, of course, with such a genius as Kālidāsa’s, the matter which is borrowed

of indebtedness impossible. But the evidence is sufficient to induce conviction to
any one accustomed to weighing literary evidence of borrowing.

<p>In Act I of the <i>Çakuntalā</i> the king is struck with the elegance of the simple bark dress worn by the heroine
in keeping with her station as a maiden of the hermitage; <i lang="und">kim iva hi madhurāṇām maṇḍanaṁ nākṛtīnām</i>, ‘For what does not grace a lovely figure?’ he asks, and illustrates his theme.<a class="noteRef" id="n124.2src" href="#n124.2">87</a> The germ of this pretty idea is found in the <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i>, Act I, where Sītā playfully decks herself in a dress of bark, evoking the judgement
of her friend: <i>savvasohaṇīaṁ surūvaṁ ṇāma</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n124.3src" href="#n124.3">88</a> The converse relationship is here incredible; Bhāsa’s imitation of Kālidāsa would
be feeble and tasteless, while Kālidāsa’s improvement on his original is apt and skilful.
The fact of borrowing is established by the episode in the same act of the <i>Çakuntalā</i> of <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>the treatment of watering the garden as an act of penance on the maiden’s part; an
idea which occurs in a closely parallel passage in Act V of the <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i>. Bhāsa treats it as bearable, illustrating it by the adduction of an example in the
technical form of an Arthāntaranyāsa,<a class="noteRef" id="n125.1src" href="#n125.1">89</a> while Kālidāsa<a class="noteRef" id="n125.2src" href="#n125.2">90</a> is more severe in his condemnation, using the technical figure Nidarçanā, clearly
a deliberate variation of the idea. In the same Act of the <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n125.3src" href="#n125.3">91</a> we find Rāma bidding Sītā take farewell of the fawns and the trees, which are her
foster-children, and of her dear friends, the Vindhya mountain and the creepers; in
the departure of Çakuntalā from the hermitage<a class="noteRef" id="n125.4src" href="#n125.4">92</a> the trees and the fawns as well as the creepers share in the grief of her departure;
of the deer is expressly used the term ‘foster-child’ found in the <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i>. Again in Act VII of that play Sītā is reminded of the distrust felt by the deer
in Bharata,<a class="noteRef" id="n125.5src" href="#n125.5">93</a> just as Çakuntalā describes their distrust of Duḥṣanta.<a class="noteRef" id="n125.6src" href="#n125.6">94</a> There is a parallel in the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i>, Act I, where Vāsavadattā is received kindly by the lady of the hermitage, and thanks
her for her courteous words, to the scene at the opening of the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, in which the king assures Anasūyā that her speech of welcome is sufficient hospitality
(<i>bhavatīnāṁ sūnṛtayaiva girā kṛtam ātithyam</i>). The parallel is completed by the instruction given by the chamberlain in Bhāsa’s
play to the servant to avoid disturbance to the hermitage with the commands of the
king to the commander-in-chief. Similar also is the scene in Act II of the <i>Svapnavāsavadattā</i>, in which during the play of Padmāvatī and Vāsavadattā in disguise reference is made
to the former’s approaching marriage, to the talk of Çakuntalā’s friends with her
in Act I. We have also in the sixth Act of either play a parallel treatment of the
lute lost by Udayana in the one case,<a class="noteRef" id="n125.7src" href="#n125.7">95</a> and the ring lost by Çakuntalā in the other;<a class="noteRef" id="n125.8src" href="#n125.8">96</a> the verses in which these innocent objects of censure are attacked are similar in
spirit and taste.
</p>
<p>Other traces of Bhāsa’s influence are also to be found. The motif of the curse of
Durvāsas which in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> explains the sufferings of the heroine suggests the curse of Caṇḍabhārgava in the
<i>Avimāraka</i> which reduces the hero to a humble rank, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> the lovers are reunited at the hermitage of the sage Mārīca, as in the <i>Avimāraka</i> they meet at the home of Nārada. There is a vague similarity also as regards many
expressions in the two poets, but it would be unwise to lay any special stress on
such testimony. But the more specific evidence given above of dependence is undeniable,
and it is surprising to find it questioned by Professor Hillebrandt,<a class="noteRef" id="n126.1src" href="#n126.1">97</a> especially when we have Kālidāsa’s own recognition of Bhāsa’s fame, and Bāṇa’s reiteration
of it.
</p>
<p>The most valid argument which might be adduced against dependence is the fact that
Kālidāsa’s dramas as they stand do not seem to agree with the rule observed in those
of Bhāsa regarding the beginning of the drama. In Bhāsa’s works the Sūtradhāra appears
on the stage at the close of a Nāndī, the text of which is not given, and recites
a verse which obviously is not technically a Nāndī, though it is of the same type,
containing a benediction. In the works of Kālidāsa the first verse is the Nāndī, and
at the close of it the Sūtradhāra begins the play with a dialogue. But we cannot rely
on the manuscripts as giving us the true practice of Kālidāsa’s date, for we know
that in the case of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> old manuscripts denied to the first verse the character of a Nāndī, and therefore
presented the play in the form affected by Bhāsa, and the same style is sometimes
followed in South Indian manuscripts of other plays. It is, therefore, impossible
to hold that Kālidāsa rejected the practice of Bhāsa, or to base any argument on the
facts.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kālidāsa refers in the prologue to the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> not only to Bhāsa but to Saumilla and Kaviputra—perhaps rather the Kaviputras—as
his predecessors in drama. Saumilla, whose name suggests an origin in Mahārāṣṭra,
is mentioned by Rājaçekhara along with Bhāsa and a third poet Rāmila. Further, the
same authority tells us that Rāmila and Somila composed a <i>Çūdrakakathā</i>, which is compared to Çiva under the form of Ardhanārīçvara, in which he is united
with his spouse, perhaps a hint at the union of heroic and love sentiments in the
tale. A fine stanza is attributed to them in the <i>Çārn̄gadharapaddhati</i>:<a class="noteRef" id="n127.1src" href="#n127.1">1</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">

<p class="line"><i>ā jñātaṁ madhulampaṭair madhukarair ārabdhakolāhale</i> </p>

<p class="first">‘Had he been ill he would have been emaciated; wounded, he would have bled; bitten,
have shown the venom; no sign of these is here; how then has the unhappy traveller
met his death? Ah! I see. When the bees began to hum as they sought greedily for honey,
the rash one let his glance fall on the mango bud’. Spring is the time for lovers’
meetings; the traveller, far from his beloved, lets himself think of her and dies
of despair.
</p>
<p>The Kaviputras, a pair according to the verse cited from them in the <i>Subhāṣitāvali</i><a class="noteRef" id="n127.2src" href="#n127.2">2</a>, were apparently also collaborators, a decidedly curious parallel with Somila and
Rāmila, as such collaboration seems later rare. The stanza is pretty:

<p class="first">‘The play of the brows, the sidelong glances which contract the corners of the eyes,
words of love, bashful laughter, the slow departure in sport, and the staying of the
steps: these are the ornaments and the weapons of women.’
</p>
<p>Strange that so scanty remnants should remain of poets who must have deserved high
praise to receive Kālidāsa’s recognition, but the fame of that poet doubtless inflicted
on them the fate that all but overtook Bhāsa himself.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Authorship and Age of the Mṛcchakaṭikā</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The discovery of the <i>Cārudatta</i> of Bhāsa has cast an unexpected light on the age of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, but has still left it dubious whether or not the author is to be placed before Kālidāsa.
That this rank was due to him was the general opinion before Professor Lévi attacked
the theory, and it is curious that later he should have inclined to doubt the value
of his earlier judgement. The existence of the <i>Cārudatta</i> would explain, of course, the silence of Kālidāsa on the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, if it existed in his time. Explicit use of the drama by Kālidāsa or the reverse
would be conclusive, but unhappily none of the parallels which can be adduced have
any effective force, and from rhetorical quotations we only have the fact that Çūdraka
was recognized as an author by Vāmana,<a class="noteRef" id="n128.1src" href="#n128.1">3</a> for Daṇḍin’s citation of a verse found in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> is now clearly known to be a citation from Bhāsa, in whose works the verse in question
twice occurs. With this falls the hypothesis of Pischel,<a class="noteRef" id="n128.2src" href="#n128.2">4</a> who, after ascribing the play to Bhāsa, later fathered it upon Daṇḍin, to make good
the number of three famous works with which he is in later tradition credited.
</p>
<p>The play itself presents Çūdraka, a king, as its author and gives curious details
of his capacities; he was an expert in the <i>Ṛgveda</i>, the <i>Sāmaveda</i>, mathematics, the arts regarding courtesans, and the science of elephants, all facts
which could be concluded from the knowledge shown in the play itself; he was cured
of some complaint, and after establishing his son in his place, and performing the
horse sacrifice, he entered the fire and <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>died at the age of a hundred years and ten days. We have a good deal more information
of a sort regarding his personality; he was to Kalhaṇa in the <i>Rājataran̄giṇī</i><a class="noteRef" id="n129.1src" href="#n129.1">5</a> a figure to be set beside Vikramāditya; the <i>Skanda Purāṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n129.2src" href="#n129.2">6</a> makes him out the first of the Andhrabhṛtyas; the <i>Vetālapañcaviṅçati</i> knows of his age as a hundred, and gives as his capital either Vardhamāna or Çobhāvatī,
which is the scene of his activities according to the <i>Kathāsaritsāgara</i>, which tells of the sacrifice of a Brahmin who saves him from imminent death and
secures his life of a hundred years by killing himself. In the <i>Kādambarī</i> he is located at Vidiçā, and in the <i>Harṣacarita</i> we hear of the device by which he got rid of his enemy Candraketu, prince of Cakora,
while Daṇḍin in the <i>Daçakumāracarita</i> refers to his adventures in several lives. The fact that Rāmila and Somila wrote
a Kathā on him is significant of his legendary character in their time, considerably
before Kālidāsa. A very late tradition in the <i>Vīracarita</i> and the younger Rājaçekhara<a class="noteRef" id="n129.3src" href="#n129.3">7</a> brings him into connexion with Sātavāhana or Çālivāhana, whose minister he was and
from whom he obtained half his kingdom, including Pratiṣṭhāna.<a class="noteRef" id="n129.4src" href="#n129.4">8</a>
</p>
<p>These references seem to suggest that Çūdraka was a merely legendary person, a fact
rather supported than otherwise by his quaint name, which is absurd in a king of normal
type. Nevertheless, Professor Konow treats him as historical, and finds in him the
Ābhīra prince Çivadatta, who, or whose son, Īçvarasena, is held by Dr. Fleet to have
overthrown the last of the Andhra dynasty and to have founded the Cedi era of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 248–9.<a class="noteRef" id="n129.5src" href="#n129.5">9</a> This remarkable result is held to be supported by the fact that in the play the king
of Ujjayinī is Pālaka, and is represented as being overthrown by Āryaka, son of a
herdsman (<i>gopāla</i>), and the Ābhīras are essentially herdsmen. But this is much more than dubious; we
have in fact legendary history in the names of Pālaka, Gopāla—to be taken probably
in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> as a proper name—and Āryaka. The proof is indeed overwhelming, for Bhāsa, who is
the source of so much of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>mentions in his <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i> as sons of Pradyota of Ujjayinī both Gopāla and Pālaka, and the <i>Bṛhatkathā</i> must have contained the story of Gopāla surrendering the kingdom on Pradyota’s death
to Pālaka, and of the latter having to make room for Āryaka, his brother’s son. To
make history out of these events, which belong to the period shortly after the Buddha’s
death, say 483 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, and history of the third century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, is really impossible. Çūdraka is really clearly mythical, as is seen by the admission
that he entered the fire, for no one can believe that he foresaw his death-day so
precisely, or that the ceremony referred to is that performed on becoming an ascetic,
or even that the prologue was added after his death; if it had been, it would have
doubtless been of a different type. Still less can we imagine that he was helped in
his work by Rāmila and Somila.
</p>
<p>Windisch,<a class="noteRef" id="n130.1src" href="#n130.1">10</a> on the other hand, attempted to prove a close similarity between the plot of the
political side of the play and the legend of Kṛṣṇa, instancing the prediction of Āryaka’s
attaining the throne, the jealousy of the king and his efforts to destroy him, and
the final overthrow of the tyrant. The similarity, however, is really remote; the
story is a commonplace in legend, and nothing can be made of the comparison.
</p>
<p>We are left, therefore, to accept the view that the author who wrote up the <i>Cārudatta</i>, and combined with it a new play, thought it well to conceal his identity and to
pass off the work under the appellation of a famous king. Lévi’s suggestion that he
chose Çūdraka for this purpose because he lived after Vikramāditya, patron of Kālidāsa,
and wished to give his work the appearance of antiquity by associating it with a prince
who preceded Vikramāditya, is clearly far-fetched, and insufficient to suggest a date.
Nor can anything be deduced from the plentiful exhibition of Prākrits, which is not,
to judge from Bhāsa, a sign of very early date; while the use of Māhārāṣṭrī Prākrit
would be, if proved, conclusive that he is fairly late. Konow’s effort to support
Çūdraka’s connexion with Pratiṣṭhāna by this use is clearly untenable.
</p>
<p>There is more plausibility in the argument from the simple form of the construction
of the drama; the manner of Bhāsa is <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>closely followed; thus in Act IX the absurd celerity with which the officer of the
court obeys the order to bring the mother of Vasantasenā on the scene, and secures
the presence of Cārudatta, is precisely on a par with Bhāsa’s management of the plot
in his dramas. The scenes of violence, in which Vasantasenā is apparently killed and
Cārudatta is led to death, are reminiscent of Bhāsa’s willingness to present such
scenes, but they do not depart from the practice of the later drama as in Bhavabhūti’s
<i>Mālatīmādhava</i>. The Çakāra and Viṭa are indeed figures of the early stage, but they are taken straight
from Bhāsa and prove nothing. The position of the Buddhist monk is more interesting,
but here again it is borrowed, though developed, and we find Buddhism respected in
Kālidāsa and Harṣa. The arguments based on the apparent similarity with the Greek
New Comedy are without value for an early date, for they apply, if they have any value
at all, to the <i>Cārudatta</i> of Bhāsa. We are left, therefore, with no more than impressions, and these are quite
insufficient to assign any date to the clever hand which recast the <i>Cārudatta</i> and made one of the great plays of the Indian drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n131.1src" href="#n131.1">11</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first four acts of the play are a reproduction with slight changes of the <i>Cārudatta</i> of Bhāsa;<a class="noteRef" id="n131.2src" href="#n131.2">12</a> the very prologue shows the fact in the inexplicable transformation in the speech
of the director, who opens in Sanskrit and then changes to Prākrit, while in the <i>Cārudatta</i> he speaks Prākrit only as fits the part of the Vidūṣaka which he is to play. The
names are slightly changed; the king’s brother-in-law is called Saṁsthānaka, and the
thief Çarvilaka. Act I carries the action up to the deposit of the gems by Vasantasenā;
Act II relates the generosity of the hetaera to the shampooer who turns monk, and
the attack made on him as he leaves her house by a mad elephant, from which Karṇapūraka,
a servant of Vasantasenā’s, saves him, receiving as reward a cloak which Vasantasenā
recognizes as Cārudatta’s. In Act III we learn of Çarvilaka’s success in stealing
the jewels, and the generous resolve of the wife of Cārudatta to give her necklace
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>replace them. In Act IV Çarvilaka gives the jewels to Vasantasenā, who, though aware
of the theft, sets his love free. As he leaves with her, he hears of the imprisonment
of his friend Āryaka by order of the king, who knows the prophecy of his attaining
the kingship, and leaving his newly-made bride, he hastens to aid his friend who is
reported to have escaped from his captivity. The Vidūṣaka then comes with the necklace,
which the hetaera accepts in order to use it as a pretext to see Cārudatta once more.
The visit occupies Act V, which passes in a storm forcing Vasantasenā to spend the
night in Cārudatta’s house. Act VI reveals her next morning offering to return to
Cārudatta’s wife the necklace, but her gift is refused. The child of Cārudatta appears,
complaining that he has only a little earth cart (<i>mṛcchakaṭikā</i>), whence the name of the play; Vasantasenā gives him her jewels that he may buy one
of gold. She is to rejoin Cārudatta in a neighbouring park, the property of Saṁsthānaka,
but by error she enters the car of Saṁsthānaka, while Āryaka, who has been seeking
a hiding-place, leaps into that of Cārudatta and is driven away; two policemen stop
the cart, and one recognizes Āryaka, but protects him from the other with whom he
contrives a quarrel. In Act VII Cārudatta, who is conversing with the Vidūṣaka, sees
his cart drive up, discovers Āryaka, and permits him to go off in it, while he himself
leaves to find Vasantasenā. In the next act Saṁsthānaka, with the Viṭa and a slave,
meets in the park the shampooer turned monk, who has gone there to wash his robe in
the tank; he insults him and beats him. The cart with Vasantasenā then is driven up,
and the angry Saṁsthānaka first tries to win her by fair words; then, repulsed, orders
the Viṭa and the slave to slay her; they indignantly refuse; he pretends to grow calm,
dismisses them, and then rains blows on Vasantasenā, who falls apparently dead; the
Viṭa, who sees his action, deserts at once his cause and passes over to Āryaka’s side.
Saṁsthānaka, after burying the body under some leaves, departs, promising himself
to put the slave in chains; the monk re-enters to dry his robe, finds and restores
to life Vasantasenā, and takes her to the monastery to be cared for. In Act IX Saṁsthānaka
denounces Cārudatta as the murderer of Vasantasenā to the court;<a class="noteRef" id="n132.1src" href="#n132.1">13</a> her <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>mother is summoned as a witness, but defends Cārudatta, who himself is cited; the
police officer testifies to the escape of Āryaka, which implicates Cārudatta; the
Vidūṣaka who enters the court, while <i>en route</i> to return to Vasantasenā the jewels she had given the child, is so indignant with
the accuser that he lets fall the jewels; this fact, taken together with the evidence
that Vasantasenā spent the night with Cārudatta and left next morning to meet him,
and the signs of struggle in the park, deceives the judge, who condemns Cārudatta
to exile; Pālaka converts the sentence into one of death. Act X reveals the hero led
to death by two Caṇḍālas, who regret the duty they have to perform; the servant of
Saṁsthānaka escapes and reveals the truth, but Saṁsthānaka makes light of his words
as a disgraced and spiteful slave, and the headsmen decide to proceed with their work.
Vasantasenā and the monk enter just in time to prevent Cārudatta’s death, and, while
the lovers rejoice at their reunion, the news is brought that Āryaka has succeeded
Pālaka whom he has slain, and that he has granted a principality to Cārudatta. The
crowd shout for Saṁsthānaka’s death, but Cārudatta pardons him, while the monk is
rewarded by being appointed superior over the Buddhist monasteries of the realm, and,
best of all, Vasantasenā is made free of her profession, and thus can become Cārudatta’s
lawful wife.
</p>
<p>To the author we may ascribe the originality of combining the political and the love
intrigue, which give together a special value to the play. We know of no precise parallel
to this combination of motifs, though in the <i>Bṛhatkathā</i> there was probably a story recorded later<a class="noteRef" id="n133.1src" href="#n133.1">14</a> of the hetaera Kumudikā who fell in love with a poor Brahmin, imprisoned by the king;
she allied herself to the fortunes of a dethroned prince Vikramasiṅha, aided him by
her arts to secure the throne, and was permitted by the grateful prince to marry her
beloved, now released from prison. The idea was doubtless current in some form or
another, just as for the incidents of Bhāsa’s story we can trace parallels in the
Kathā literature of hetaerae who love honest and poor men and desire to abandon for
their sakes their hereditary and obligatory calling, which the law will compel them
to follow.<a class="noteRef" id="n133.2src" href="#n133.2">15</a> The conception of the science of theft is neatly paralleled in the <i>Daçakumāracarita</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>where a text-book of the subject is ascribed to Karṇīsuta, and the same work contains
interesting accounts of gambling which illustrate Act II. The <i>Kathāsaritsāgara</i><a class="noteRef" id="n134.1src" href="#n134.1">16</a> tells of a ruined gambler, who takes refuge in an empty shrine, and describes in
Sarga xxxviii the palace of the hetaera Madanamālā in terms which may be compared
with the description by the Vidūṣaka in Act IV of the splendours of Vasantasenā’s
palace.<a class="noteRef" id="n134.2src" href="#n134.2">17</a> The court scene conforms duly to the requirements of the legal Smṛtis of the sixth
and seventh centuries <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, but the conservatism of the law renders this no sign of date.
</p>
<p>Though composite in origin and in no sense a transcript from life, the merits of the
<i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> are great and most amply justify what else would have been an inexcusable plagiarism.
The hints given in the <i>Cārudatta</i> here appear in full and harmonious development aided and heightened by the introduction
of the intrigue, which combines the private affairs of the hero with the fate of the
city and kingdom. Cārudatta’s character is attractive in the extreme; considerate
to his friend the Vidūṣaka, honouring and respecting his wife, deeply devoted to his
little son, Rohasena, he loves Vasantasenā with an affection free from all mere passion;
he has realized her nobility of character, her generosity, and the depth and truth
of her love. Yet his devotion is only a part of his life; aware of the vanity of all
human things, he does not value life over-highly; his condemnation affects him most
because it strikes at his honour that he should have murdered a woman, and he leaves
thus to his child a heritage of shame. Not less attractive is Vasantasenā, bound,
despite herself, to a profession which has brought her great wealth but which offends
her heart; the judge and all the others believe her merely carried away by sensual
passion; Cārudatta and his wife alone recognize her nobility of soul, and realize
how much it means for her to be made eligible for marriage to her beloved. There is
an admirable contrast with the hero in the Çakāra Saṁsthānaka, who is described vividly
and realistically. His position as brother-in-law of the king and his wealth make
him believe that he is entitled to whatever he wants; Vasantasenā’s repulse of him
outrages his sense of his own importance <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>more than anything else; brutal, ignorant<a class="noteRef" id="n135.1src" href="#n135.1">18</a> despite his association with courtiers of breeding and refinement, and cowardly,
he has only skill in perfidy and deceit, and is mean enough to beg piteously for the
life he has forfeited, but which Cārudatta magnanimously spares. The Viṭa is an excellent
foil to him in his culture, good taste, and high breeding; despite his dependence
on his patron, he checks his violence to Vasantasenā, strives to prevent his effort
to murder her, and when he fails in this takes his life into his own hands and passes
over to Āryaka’s side. The Vidūṣaka may be fond of food and comfortable living, but
he remains faithful in adversity to his master, is prepared to die for him, and consents
to live only to care for his son.
</p>
<p>The minor characters among the twenty-seven in all who appear have each an individuality
rare in Indian drama. Çarvilaka, once a Brahmin, now a professional thief, performs
his new functions with all the precision appropriate to the performance of religious
rites according to the text-books. The shampooer, turned Buddhist monk, has far too
much worldly knowledge to seek any temporal preferment from the favour of Āryaka.
Māthura, the master gambler, is a hardened sinner without bowels of compassion, but
the two headsmen are sympathetic souls who perform reluctantly their painful duty.
The wife of Cārudatta is a noble and gentle lady worthy of her husband, and one who
in the best Indian fashion does not grudge him a new love if worthy, while the lively
maid Madanikā deserves fully her freedom and marriage with Çarvilaka. Even characters
which play so small an actual part as Āryaka are effectively indicated. The good taste
of the author is strikingly revealed by the alteration made in the last scene by a
certain Nīlakaṇṭha,<a class="noteRef" id="n135.2src" href="#n135.2">19</a> who holds that the omission to bring upon the stage Cārudatta’s wife, his son, and
the Vidūṣaka was due to the risk of making the time occupied by the representation
of the play too great. He supplies the lacuna by representing all three as determined
to commit suicide when Cārudatta rescues them; the author himself would never have
consented to introduce the first wife at the moment when a second is about to be taken.
</p>
<p>The author is not merely admirable in characterization; he is <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>master of pathos, as in the parting of Cārudatta from his son who asks the headsman
to kill him and let his father go, and above all he abounds in humour and wit; even
in the last act Goha, the headman, relieves the tension by the tale of his father
who advised him on his death-bed not to slay too quickly the criminal on the off-chance
that there might be a revolution or something to save the wretch’s life, and, when
after deliverance comes the noble Cārudatta forbids the slaying with steel of the
grovelling Saṁsthānaka, Çarvilaka cheerfully remarks that is all right: he will be
eaten alive by the dogs instead.
</p>
<p>These merits and the wealth of incident of the drama more than compensate for the
overluxuriance of the double intrigue, and the lack of unity, which is unquestionable.
A demerit in the eyes of the writers on poetics is the absence of elaborate descriptions,
but the simple and clear diction of the play adds greatly to its liveliness and dramatic
effect, and the poet has perfect command of the power of pithy and forcible expression.
The Viṭa effectually rebukes the arrogance and pride of family of Saṁsthānaka:

<p class="line"><i>kiṁ kulenopadiṣṭena çīlam evātra kāraṇam</i> </p>

<p class="first">‘I fear not death, but my honour is sullied; were that stain removed, death would

<p class="first">‘Ah! Rohasena, since thou dost not know my plight, ever dost thou rejoice in thy play
falsely, for sorrow is in store.’
</p>
<p>The character of Cārudatta is effectively portrayed by the Vidūṣaka:<a class="noteRef" id="n137.1src" href="#n137.1">20</a>

which we extol; other men merely breathe.’
</p>
<p>The evils of poverty are forcibly depicted by Cārudatta himself:<a class="noteRef" id="n137.2src" href="#n137.2">21</a>

</div>
<p class="first">‘Like empty houses, in truth, are poor men, or wells without water or blasted trees;

The same idea is again expressed by the hero:<a class="noteRef" id="n137.3src" href="#n137.3">22</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>satyaṁ na me vibhavanāçakṛtāsti cintā: bhāgyakrameṇa hi dhanāni bhavanti yānti</i> </p>

<p class="first">‘My dejection, assuredly, is not born of the mere loss of my wealth, for with the

becomes, indeed, wearisome, but the ingenuity and fancy of the author are undoubted.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>Love is also effectively described. The Viṭa is an admirer of Vasantasenā and thus
addresses the fleeting lady:<a class="noteRef" id="n138.1src" href="#n138.1">23</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">‘Happy the life of those whose limbs embrace the limbs of their loved ones, come to

</p>
<p>Moreover, while to later Indian critics the descriptive stanzas of the poet are lacking
in that elaboration and cleverness which are admitted by developed taste, to us much
of the poetic value of the drama depends on the power of the poet to describe with
point and feeling in simple terms which require no effort to appreciate. The whole
scene of the storm gains by the stanzas in which its beauties are described, once
we consent, as we must do in appreciating any Sanskrit play, to ignore the inappropriateness
of these lyric effusions in the actual circumstances. In real life a lady seeking
eagerly an interview with her beloved, in resplendent attire, would have no time to
display her command of Sanskrit poetry in description, when counsels of prudence urged
her to her destination with the least possible delay:<a class="noteRef" id="n138.3src" href="#n138.3">25</a>

</p>
<p>The merits of the play are sufficient to enable its author to dispense with praise
not deserved. For Çūdraka, regarded as the author, has been credited<a class="noteRef" id="n139.5src" href="#n139.5">30</a> with the distinction of being a cosmopolitan; however great the difference between
Kālidāsa, ‘the grace of poetry’<a class="noteRef" id="n139.6src" href="#n139.6">31</a> and Bhavabhūti, ‘the master of eloquence,’<a class="noteRef" id="n139.7src" href="#n139.7">32</a> these two authors, it is said, are far more allied in spirit than is either of them
with the author of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>; the <i>Çakuntalā</i> and the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> could have been produced nowhere save in India, Çakuntalā is a Hindu maid, Mādhava
a Hindu hero, while Saṁsthānaka, Maitreya, and Madanikā are citizens of the world.
This claim, however, can hardly be admitted; the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> as a whole is a drama redolent of Indian thought and life, and none of the three
characters adduced have any special claim to be more cosmopolitan than some of the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>creations of Kālidāsa. The variety of the characters of the play is unquestionably
laudable, but the praise in part is due to Bhāsa, and not to his successor. To the
same source also must be attributed the comparative simplicity of the style, which
certainly contrasts with the degree of elaboration found even in Kālidāsa, and carried
much further in Bhavabhūti. The variety of incident is foreshadowed in Bhāsa, but
the development of the drama must be attributed to the author, and frankly it cannot
be said to be wholly artistic; that the drama is unnecessarily complex must be conceded,
nor can the action be said to proceed with complete ease and conviction. The humour
of the play is undoubted, but here again to Bhāsa must honour be given. Bhāsa again
is the prototype for the neglect of the rule of the dramaturgy which demands the presence
of the hero on the stage in each act; the naming of the play, in defiance of convention,
from a minor incident may justly be ascribed to the author himself.
</p>
<p>The real Indian character of the drama reveals itself in the demand for the conventional
happy ending, which shows us every person in a condition of happiness, with the solitary
exception of the evil king. Cārudatta is restored to affluence and power from the
depths of infamy and misery; Vasantasenā’s virtue and fidelity are rewarded by the
signal honour of restoration to the rank of one whom the hero may marry; the monk,
who refuses worldly gain, has the pleasure of becoming charged with spiritual oversight,
with its attendant amenities—not inconsiderable to judge from our knowledge of the
wealth of Buddhist monasteries. Even Saṁsthānaka is spared, to save us, we may assume,
the pain of seeing anything so unpleasant as a real, even if well deserved, death
on the stage, for the king perishes at a distance from the scene. If, as Cārudatta
asserts at the end of the play, fate plays with men like buckets at the well, one
rising as another falls, Çūdraka is not inclined to seek realism sufficiently to permit
of his introducing even a tinge of sorrow into the close of his drama.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>The Prākrits</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No extant play exhibits anything like the variety of Prākrits found in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, which seems almost as if intended to <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>illustrate the precepts of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> in this regard.<a class="noteRef" id="n141.1src" href="#n141.1">33</a> The commentator obligingly provides us with the names of the dialects represented
and those who speak them. Çaurasenī is spoken by the director after his Sanskrit exordium,
the comedienne, Vasantasenā, Madanikā, her servant, Karṇapūraka, her slave, her mother,
the wife of Cārudatta, the Çreṣṭhin or guildsman, and the officer of the court, and
Radanikā, Cārudatta’s servant. Avantikā is attributed to the two policemen Vīraka
and Candanaka. The Vidūṣaka speaks Prācyā. The shampooer who turns monk, Sthāvaraka,
servant of the Çakāra Saṁsthānaka, Kumbhīlaka, servant of Vasantasenā, Vardhamānaka,
servant of Cārudatta, and the little Rohasena speak Māgadhī. The Çakāra speaks Çākārī,
the Caṇḍālas who act as headsmen Cāṇḍālī, and the chief gambler Ḍhakkī. Sanskrit,
on the other hand, is spoken by the hero, the Viṭa, the royal claimant Āryaka, and
the Brahmin thief Çarvilaka. This distribution of Prākrits agrees with that of the
<i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> as we have it in one important aspect; it ignores the Māhārāṣṭrī, though for some
not obvious reason Konow claims that this was introduced into the drama by Çūdraka.
On the other hand, it does not assign to slaves, Rājputs, or guildsmen the Ardha-Māgadhī
of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>. In the case of Rohasena the Māgadhī ascribed to him has been largely converted into
Çaurasenī in the manuscripts. The Çāstra ascribes Āvantī to Dhūrtas, which is interpreted
as meaning gamblers; the distinction between it and Çaurasenī is minimal; it is said
to have <i>s</i> and <i>r</i> and be rich in proverbs by Pṛthvīdhara, and this accords adequately with the actual
speeches of the officers. But the second, Candanaka, expressly gives himself out as
a southerner, and we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the dialect is Dākṣiṇātyā
which the Çāstra ascribes to warriors, police officers, and gamblers. The Prācyā of
the Vidūṣaka is nothing more or less than Çaurasenī, though it is given separately
in the Çāstra also; it may have been an eastern dialect of the main language. The
Ḍhakkī ascribed to the gamblers should probably<a class="noteRef" id="n141.2src" href="#n141.2">34</a> be named Ṭakkī, or Ṭākkī, an easy error because of the confusion of the letters in
manuscripts. Pischel regarded it as an eastern dialect which had <i>l</i>, and preserved two <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>sibilants <i>ç</i> and <i>s</i> in which <i>ṣ</i> was merged; Sir G. Grierson finds in it a western dialect, which seems more probable.
The Çākārī of Saṁsthānaka is nothing more or less than Māgadhī, which is given as
the language of that person by the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, and the Cāṇḍālī is merely another variety of that Prākrit. Thus the rich variety
reduces itself in effect to Çaurasenī<a class="noteRef" id="n142.1src" href="#n142.1">35</a> and Māgadhī with <span class="corr" id="xd32e6209" title="Source: Takkī">Ṭakkī</span>, of which we have too little to say precisely what it was.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The author of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> shows considerable skill in metrical handling; his favourite metre is naturally enough
the Çloka, which suits his rapid style and is adapted to further the progress of the
dialogue. It occurs 83 times, while the next favourite, the pretty Vasantatilaka,
appears 39 times, and the Çārdūlavikrīḍita 32 times. The only other important metres
are the Indravajrā (26), with the Vaṅçasthā (9), and the Upajāti combination of both
(5). But there occur also the Puṣpitāgrā, Praharṣiṇī, Mālinī, Vidyunmālā,<a class="noteRef" id="n142.2src" href="#n142.2">36</a> Vaiçvadevī, Çikhariṇī, Sragdharā, and Hariṇī, and one irregular stanza. Of the Āryā
there are 21 cases, including one Gīti, with 30 morae in each half stanza, and there
are two instances of the Aupacchandasika. The Prākrit metres show considerable variety;
of the Āryā type there are 53 as against 44 of other types.<a class="noteRef" id="n142.3src" href="#n142.3">37</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is unfortunate, though as in the case of Shakespeare not surprising, that we know
practically nothing of the life and age of Kālidāsa save what we can infer from his
works and from the general history of Sanskrit literature. There are indeed stories<a class="noteRef" id="n143.1src" href="#n143.1">1</a> of his ignorance in youth, until he was given poetic power by the grace of Kālī,
whence his strange style of Kālidāsa, slave of Kālī, which is not one <i>prima facie</i> to be expected in the case of a poet who shows throughout his work the finest flower
of Brahmanical culture. But these tales are late and worthless, and equally without
value is the fiction that he was a contemporary of King Bhoja of Dhārā in the first
half of the eleventh century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> As little value, however, attaches to a tale which has been deemed of greater value,
the alleged death of Kālidāsa in Ceylon when on a visit there by the hand of a courtesan,
and the discovery of his murder by his friend Kumāradāsa, identified with the king
of that name of the early part of the sixth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> The tradition, as I showed in 1901, is very late, unsupported by the earliest evidence,
and totally without value.<a class="noteRef" id="n143.2src" href="#n143.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>The most prevalent tradition makes Kālidāsa a contemporary of Vikramāditya, and treats
him as one of the nine jewels of that monarch’s entourage. Doubtless the king meant
by the tradition, which is late and of uncertain provenance, is the Vikramāditya whose
name is associated with the era of 57 <span class="asc">B.C.</span> and who is credited with a victory over the Çakas. Whatever truth there may be in
the legend, and in this regard we have nothing but conjecture,<a class="noteRef" id="n143.3src" href="#n143.3">3</a> there is not the slightest reason to accept so early a date for Kālidāsa, and it
has now no serious supporter outside India. But, based on Fergusson’s suggestion<a class="noteRef" id="n143.4src" href="#n143.4">4</a> that the era of <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>57 <span class="asc">B.C.</span> was based on a real victory over Hūṇas in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 544, the reckoning being antedated 600 years, Max Müller<a class="noteRef" id="n144.1src" href="#n144.1">5</a> adopted the view that Kālidāsa flourished about that period, a suggestion which was
supported by the fact that Varāhamihira, also a jewel, certainly belongs to that century,
and others of the jewels might without great difficulty be assigned to the same period.
The theory in so far as it rested on Fergusson’s hypothesis has been definitely demolished
by conclusive proof of the existence of the era, as that of the Mālavas, before <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 544, but the date has been supported on other grounds. Thus Dr. Hoernle<a class="noteRef" id="n144.2src" href="#n144.2">6</a> found it most probable that the victor who was meant by Vikramāditya in tradition
was the king Yaçodharman, conqueror of the Hūṇas, and the same view was at one time
supported by Professor Pathak,<a class="noteRef" id="n144.3src" href="#n144.3">7</a> who laid stress on the fact that Kālidāsa in his account of the Digvijaya, or tour
of conquest of the earth, of the ancient prince Raghu in the <i>Raghuvaṅça</i><a class="noteRef" id="n144.4src" href="#n144.4">8</a> refers to the Hūṇas, and apparently locates them in Kashmir, because he mentions
the saffron which grows only in Kashmir.
</p>
<p>An earlier date, to bring Kālidāsa under the Guptas, has been favoured by other authorities,
who have found that the reference to a conquest of the Hūṇas must be held to be allusion
to a contemporary event. This date is attained on second thoughts by Professor Pathak,<a class="noteRef" id="n144.5src" href="#n144.5">9</a> who places the Hūṇas on the Oxus on this view, and holds that Kālidāsa wrote his
poem shortly after <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 450, the date of the first establishment of their empire in the Oxus valley, but
before their first defeat by Skandagupta, which took place before <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 455, when they were still in the Oxus valley and were considered the most invincible
warriors of the age. On the other hand, Monmohan Chakravarti,<a class="noteRef" id="n144.6src" href="#n144.6">10</a> who converted Professor Pathak to belief in the contemporaneity of Kālidāsa with
the Guptas, places the date at between <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 480 and 490, on the theory that the Hūṇas were in Kālidāsa’s time in Kashmir. The
whole argument, however, appears fallacious; Raghu is represented as conquering the
Persians, and there is no <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>contemporary ground for this allegation; manifestly we have no serious historical
reminiscences, but, as is natural in a Brahmanical poet, a reference of the type of
the epic which knows perfectly well the Hūṇas. The exact identity of the Hūṇas of
the epic is immaterial; as the name had penetrated to the western world by the second
century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> if not earlier, there is no conceivable reason for assuming that it could not have
reached India long before the fifth or sixth centuries <span class="asc">A.D.</span><a class="noteRef" id="n145.1src" href="#n145.1">11</a>
</p>
<p>Other evidence is scanty. Mallinātha, as is notorious, finds in verse 14 of the <i>Meghadūta</i> a reference to a poet Nicula, a friend of Kālidāsa, and an enemy Dignāga; the latter
would be the famous Buddhist logician, and, assuming that his date is the fifth century
<span class="asc">A.D.</span>, we have an argument for placing Kālidāsa in the fifth or sixth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> But the difficulties of this argument are insurmountable. In the first place, it
is extremely difficult to accept the alleged reference to Nicula, who is otherwise
a mere name, and to Dignāga; why a Buddhist logician should have attacked a poet does
not appear, especially as every other record of the conflict is lost. Nor is the <i>double entendre</i> at all in Kālidāsa’s manner;<a class="noteRef" id="n145.2src" href="#n145.2">12</a> such efforts are little in harmony with Kālidāsa’s age, while later they are precisely
what is admitted, and are naturally seen by the commentators where not really intended.
It is significant that the allusion is not noted by Vallabhadeva, and that it first
occurs in Dakṣināvarta Nātha (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1200) and Mallinātha (fourteenth century), many centuries after the latest date assignable
to Kālidāsa. Even, however, if the reference were real, the date of Dignāga can no
longer be placed confidently in the fifth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, or with other authorities in the sixth century. On the contrary, there is a good
deal of evidence which suggests that <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 400 is as late as he can properly be placed.<a class="noteRef" id="n145.3src" href="#n145.3">13</a>
</p>
<p>As little can any conclusion be derived from the allusion in Vāmana to a son of Candragupta
in connexion with Vasubandhu, which has led to varied efforts at identification, based
largely on the fifth century as the date of Vasubandhu. But it is far more <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>probable that Vasubandhu dates from the early part of the fourth century, and nothing
can be derived hence to aid in determining the period of Kālidāsa.<a class="noteRef" id="n146.1src" href="#n146.1">14</a>
</p>
<p>More solid evidence must be sought in the astronomical or astrological data which
are found in Kālidāsa. Professor Jacobi has seen in the equalization of the midday
with the sixth Kāla in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> a proof of Kālidāsa’s having lived in the period immediately subsequent to the introduction
from the west of the system of reckoning for ordinary purposes the day by 12 Horās,
Kāla being evidently used as Horā. The passage has been interpreted by Huth as referring
to a sixteenfold division, and the argument to be derived from it is not established,
but Huth, on the other hand, manifestly errs by making Kālidāsa posterior to Āryabhaṭa
(<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 499) on the score that in the <i>Raghuvaṅça</i> he refers to eclipses as caused by the shadow of the earth, the reference being plainly
to the old doctrine of the spots on the moon. It is, however, probable that Kālidāsa
in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> refers to the figure of the lion in the zodiac, borrowed from the west, and it is
certain that he was familiar with the system of judicial astrology, which India owes
to the west, for he alludes both in the <i>Raghuvaṅça</i> and the <i>Kumārasambhava</i> to the influence of the planets, and above all uses technical terms like <i>ucca</i> and even <i>jāmitra</i>, borrowed from Greece. A date not probably prior to <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 350 is indicated by such passages.<a class="noteRef" id="n146.2src" href="#n146.2">15</a>
</p>
<p>Similar evidence can be derived from Kālidāsa’s Prākrit, which is plainly more advanced
than that of Bhāsa, while his Māhārāṣṭrī can be placed with reasonable assurance after
that of the earlier Māhārāṣṭrī lyric, which may have flourished in the third and fourth
centuries <span class="asc">A.D.</span> He is also earlier than the Aihole inscription of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 634, where he is celebrated, than Bāṇa (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 620), and above all than Vatsabhaṭṭi’s Mandasor Praçasti of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 473. It is, therefore, most probable that he flourished under Candragupta II of Ujjayinī,
who ruled up to about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 413 with the style of Vikramāditya, which is perhaps alluded to in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>name <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, while the <i>Kumārasambhava’s</i> title may well hint a compliment on the birth of young Kumāragupta, his son and successor.<a class="noteRef" id="n147.1src" href="#n147.1">16</a> The <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> with its marked insistence on the horse sacrifice of the drama seems to suggest a
period in Kālidāsa’s early activity when the memory of the first horse sacrifice for
long performed by an Indian king, that of Samudragupta, was fresh in men’s minds.
Moreover the poems of Kālidāsa are essentially those of the Gupta period, when the
Brahmanical and Indian tendencies of the dynasty were in full strength and the menace
of foreign attack was for the time evanescent.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Three Dramas of Kālidāsa</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n147.2src" href="#n147.2">17</a> is unquestionably the first dramatic work<a class="noteRef" id="n147.3src" href="#n147.3">18</a> of Kālidāsa; he seeks in the prologue to excuse his presumption of presenting a new
play when tried favourites such as Bhāsa, Saumilla, and the Kaviputras exist, and
in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> also he shows some diffidence, which has disappeared in the <i>Çakuntalā</i>. The great merits of the poet are far less clearly exhibited here than in his other
plays, but the identity of authorship is unquestionable, and was long ago proved by
Weber against the doubts of Wilson.
</p>
<p>The play, performed at a spring festival, probably at Ujjayinī, is a Nāṭaka in five
Acts, and depicts a love drama of the type seen already in Bhāsa’s plays on the theme
of Udayana. The heroine Mālavikā is a Vidarbha princess, who is destined as the bride
of Agnimitra; her brother, Mādhavasena, however, is captured by his cousin Yajñasena;
she escapes and seeks Agnimitra, but <i>en route</i> to his capital in Vidiçā her escort is attacked <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>by foresters, perhaps by order of the rival Vidarbha prince; she escapes again, however,
and reaches Vidiçā, where she finds refuge in the home of the queen Dhāriṇī, who has
her trained in the art of dancing. The king happens to see a picture in which she
is depicted, and falls in love with her. To arrange an interview is not easy, but
Gautama, his Vidūṣaka, provokes a quarrel between two masters of the dance, who have
recourse to the king to decide the issue of superiority. He in turn refers the matter
to the nun Kauçikī, who is in reality a partisan of Mālavikā, who had been in her
charge and that of her brother, who was killed when the escort was dispersed. She
bids the masters produce each his best pupil; Gaṇadāsa brings out Mālavikā, whose
singing and dancing delight all, while her beauty ravishes the king more than ever.
She is victorious. In Act III the scene changes to the park, whither comes Mālavikā
at the bidding of Dhāriṇī to make the Açoka blossom, according to the ancient belief,
by the touch of her foot. The king hidden with the Vidūṣaka behind a thicket watches
her, but so also does Irāvatī, the younger of Agnimitra’s queens, who is suspicious
and jealous of any rival in the king’s love. The king overhears Mālavikā’s conversation
with her friend, and realizes that his love is shared; he comes forth and embraces
her, but Irāvatī springs out of her hiding-place and insults the king. Dhāriṇī has
Mālavikā confined to prevent any further development of the intrigue. The Vidūṣaka,
however, proves equal to the occasion with the aid of Kauçikī; he declares himself
bitten by a snake; the only remedy proves to require the use of a stone in the queen’s
ring, which is accorded for that purpose, but employed for the more useful end of
securing the release of Mālavikā, and the meeting of the lovers, which Irāvatī, who
has excellent grounds for her vigilance, again disturbs. The king’s embarrassment
is fortunately mitigated by the necessity of his going to the rescue of the little
princess Vasulakṣmī, whom a monkey has frightened. Act V cuts the knot by the advent
of two unexpected pieces of news; envoys come bearing the report of victory over the
prince of Vidarbha and conveying captives; two young girls introduced before the queen
as singers recognize both Kauçikī and their princess Mālavikā among the queen’s attendants,
and Kauçikī explains her silence on the <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>princess’s identity by obedience to a prophecy. Further, Puṣyamitra, Agnimitra’s father,
sends tidings of victory from the north; the son of Dhāriṇī, Vasumitra, has defeated
the Yavanas on the bank of the Indus, while guarding the sacrificial horse, which
by ancient law is let loose to roam for a year unfettered before a king can perform
rightfully the horse sacrifice, which marks him as emperor. Dhāriṇī already owes Mālavikā
a guerdon for her service in causing the Açoka plant to blossom; delighted by the
news of her son’s success, she gladly gives Agnimitra authority to marry Mālavikā,
Irāvatī begs her pardon, and all ends in happiness.
</p>
<p>Puṣyamitra, Agnimitra, and Vasumitra are clearly taken from the dynasty of the Çun̄gas,
formed by the first through the deposition of the last Maurya in 178 <span class="asc">B.C.</span><a class="noteRef" id="n149.1src" href="#n149.1">19</a> Contact with Yavanas in his time is recorded and the horse sacrifice is doubtless
traditional, but equally it may reflect the sacrifice of Samudragupta, the most striking
event of the early Gupta history, since it asserted the imperial sway of the family.
The rest of the play is based on the normal model.
</p>
<p>The <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n149.2src" href="#n149.2">20</a> by many reckoned as the last work<a class="noteRef" id="n149.3src" href="#n149.3">21</a> in drama of Kālidāsa, seems rather to fall in the interval between the youthful <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> and the mature perfection of the <i>Çakuntalā</i>. The theme is that of the love of Purūravas, a king, and Urvaçī, an Apsaras, or heavenly
nymph. The prologue, which has been unjustly suspected of being proof of the incompleteness
and therefore later date of the drama, is followed by screams of the nymphs from whom
Urvaçī on her return from Kailāsa has been torn away by a demon; the king hastens
to her aid, recovers her, and restores her first to her friends, and then to the Gandharva
king, but not before both have fallen desperately in love. In the entr’acte a servant
of the queen extracts cleverly from the Vidūṣaka the secret of the change which has
come over the king, his love for Urvaçī. The king himself then appears; in conversation
with the Vidūṣaka he <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>declares his love, to meet with scant sympathy; Urvaçī and a friend appear in the
air, and Urvaçī drops a letter written on birch bark breathing her love; the king
reads it and gives it to the Vidūṣaka; Urvaçī’s friend appears, and finally Urvaçī
herself, but after a brief exchange of love passages Urvaçī is recalled to play a
part in heaven in a drama produced by Bharata. The message, unluckily, falls into
the queen’s hands, and she refuses to be appeased by Purūravas’s attempts to soothe
her. In the entr’acte before Act II we learn from a conversation between two pupils
of Bharata that Urvaçī was so deeply in love that she played badly her part in the
piece on Lakṣmī’s wedding; asked whom she loved, she answered Purūravas instead of
Puruṣottama, Viṣṇu’s name, and Bharata cursed her; but Indra intervened and gave her
leave to dwell on earth with her love until he had seen the face of her child. The
Act that follows shows the king, anxious to please the queen, engaged with her in
celebrating the festival of the moon’s union with Rohiṇī; Urvaçī and her friend, in
disguise and unseen by the king in a fairy mist, watch his courtesy which fills the
nymph with anguish, though her friend assures her that it is mere courtesy. To her
joy she finds that the queen has decided to be reconciled, and to permit the king
the enjoyment of his beloved; pressed to stay with the king, she refuses, and Urvaçī
joins Purūravas, her friend leaving her, bidding Purūravas to care for her so that
she may not miss her friends in the sky.
</p>
<p>The prelude to Act IV tells us of misfortune; the nymphs who mourn by the sea her
absence learn that, angry at her husband for some trivial cause, she had entered the
grove of Kumāra, forbidden to women, and been turned into a creeper. In distraction<a class="noteRef" id="n150.1src" href="#n150.1">22</a> the king seeks for her; he deems the cloud a demon which has stolen her away, demands
of the peacock, the cuckoo, the flamingo, the bee, the elephant, the boar, the antelope
what has become of her; he deems her transformed into the stream, whose waves are
the movements of her eyebrows while the rows of birds in its waters are her girdle;
he dances, sings, cries, faints in his madness, or deems the echo to be answering
<span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>him, until a voice from heaven tells him of a magic stone, armed with which he grasps
a creeper which in his embrace turns into Urvaçī.
</p>
<p>From this lyric height the drama declines in Act V. The king and his beloved are back
in his capital; the moon festival is being celebrated, but the magic stone is stolen
by a vulture, which, however, falls pierced by the arrow of a youthful archer; the
arrow bears the inscription, ‘the arrow of Āyus, son of Urvaçī and Purūravas’. The
king had known nothing of the child, but, while he is amazed, a woman comes from a
hermitage with a gallant boy, who, educated in the duties of his warrior caste, has
by his slaying the bird violated the rule of the hermitage and is now returned to
his mother. Urvaçī, summoned, admits her parentage, but, while Purūravas is glad,
she weeps to think of their severance, now inevitable, since he has seen his son.
But, while Purūravas is ready to abandon the realm to the boy and retire to the forest
in grief, Nārada comes with a message of good tidings; a battle is raging between
the gods and the demons; Purūravas’s arms will be necessary, and in reward he may
have Urvaçī’s society for his life.
</p>
<p>The play has come down in two recensions, one preserved in Bengālī and Devanāgarī
manuscripts and commented on by Ran̄ganātha in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1656, and the other in South Indian manuscripts, commented on by Kāṭayavema, minister
of the Reḍḍi prince, Kumāragiri of Koṇḍavīḍu about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1400. The most important among many differences is the fact that in Act IV the northern
manuscripts give a series of Apabhraṅça verses, with directions as to the mode of
singing and accompanying them, which are ignored in the southern manuscripts. The
northern text calls the play a Troṭaka, apparently from the dance which accompanied
the verses, the southern a Nāṭaka which it in essentials is. The arguments against
the authenticity of the verses are partly the silence of the theorists, the fact that
the existence in Kālidāsa’s time of Apabhraṅça of the type found is more than dubious,<a class="noteRef" id="n151.1src" href="#n151.1">23</a> that there is sometimes a degree of discrepancy between the verses and the prose
of the drama, and that in the many imitations of the scene (<i>Mālatīmādhava</i>, Act IX, <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i>, Act V, <i>Prasannarāghava</i>, Act VI, and <i>Mahānāṭaka</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>Act IV) there are no similar verses. These reasons are on the whole conclusive, and
the problematic fact that the Prākrit of the northern recension is better is not of
importance.
</p>
<p>The <i>Çakuntalā</i><a class="noteRef" id="n152.1src" href="#n152.1">24</a> certainly represents the perfection of <span class="corr" id="xd32e6553" title="Source: Kālīdāsa’s">Kālidāsa’s</span> art, and may justly be assumed to belong to his latest period of work. The prologue
with his usual skill leads us up to the picture of the king in swift pursuit of an
antelope entering the outskirts of the hermitage; warned of the sacred character of
the spot, the king alights from his chariot and decides to pay his respects to the
holy man whose hermitage it is; he is absent, but Çakuntalā, his foster-daughter,
is there with her friends; pursued by a bee she calls for help; they reply that Duḥṣanta
the king should aid as the hermitage is under his protection, and the king gallantly
comes forward to help. From the maidens he elicits the tale of Çakuntalā’s birth;
she is daughter of Viçvāmitra and Menakā, and is being reared not for the religious
life but for marriage to some worthy one. The king loves and the maiden begins to
reciprocate his affection, when the news that a wild elephant is menacing the hermitage
takes him away. Act II reveals his Vidūṣaka groaning over the toils of the king’s
hunting. But the king gives order for the hunt to end, not to please the Vidūṣaka
but for Çakuntalā’s sake, and, while he recounts his feelings to his unsympathetic
friend, receives with keen satisfaction the request of the young hermits to protect
the hermitage against the attacks of demons. The Vidūṣaka he gets rid of by sending
him back to the capital to take part in a festival there, assuring him, in order to
prevent domestic trouble, that his remarks about Çakuntalā were not serious. In the
entr’acte before Act III a young Brahmin praises the deeds of Duḥṣanta, and we learn
that Çakuntalā is unwell, and her maidens are troubled regarding her state, as she
is the very life breath of Kaṇva. The Act itself depicts Çakuntalā with her maidens;
she is deeply in love and writes a letter at their suggestion: the king who has overheard
all comes on the scene and a dialogue follows, in which both the king and the maiden
express their feelings; the scene is <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>ended by the arrival of the nun Gautamī to fetch away her charge. The entr’acte that
follows tells us from the conversation of Priyaṁvadā and Anasūyā, Çakuntalā’s dear
friends, that the king after his marriage with Çakuntalā has departed and seems to
have forgotten her; while Kaṇva is about to return and knows nothing of the affair.
A loud cry interrupts them; Çakuntalā in her love-sickness has failed to pay due respect
to the harsh ascetic Durvāsas, who has come to visit the hermitage: he curses her,
and all the entreaties of her friends succeed in no more than mitigating the harshness
of his curse; she will be forgotten by her husband, not indeed for ever, but until
she presents to him the ring he gave her in token of their union. The curse is essential;
the whole action of the play depends on it. The Act itself tells us that the difficulty
regarding Kaṇva has been solved; a voice from the sky has informed him at the moment
of his return of the marriage and Çakuntalā’s approaching maternity. He has decided
to send her under escort to the king. Then follows a scene of intense pathos; the
aged hermit unwillingly parts with his beloved foster-daughter, with words of advice
for her future life, and Çakuntalā is desolated to leave him, her friends, and all
that she has loved at the hermitage.
</p>
<p>Act V shows us the king in his court, overwhelmed with the duties of office, for Kālidāsa
takes care to show us Duḥṣanta as the great and good monarch. News is brought that
hermits with women desire an interview, while a song is heard in which the queen Haṅsavatī
laments the king’s faithlessness to her; the king dispatches the Vidūṣaka to solace
her, and receives in state the hermits. They bring him his wife, but, under the malign
influence of the curse, he does not recognize her and cannot receive her. The hermits
reprove him, and insist on leaving her, refusing her the right to go with them, since
her duty is by her husband’s side. The king’s priest is willing to give her the safety
of his house till the babe be born, but a figure of light in female shape appears
and bears Çakuntalā away, leaving the king still unrecognizing, but filled with wonder.
In the entr’acte which follows a vital element is contributed; policemen mishandle
a fisherman accused of theft of a royal ring found in a fish which he has caught;
it is Duḥṣanta’s ring which Çakuntalā had dropped while bathing. The Act that follows
tells us of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>recognition by the king of the wrong unwittingly done and his grief at the loss of
his wife; he seeks to console himself with her portrait, when he is interrupted by
a lady of the harem, and then by the minister, who obtains from him the decision of
a law case involving the right of succession; the episode reminds the king of his
childlessness. From his despair the king is awakened by the screams of the Vidūṣaka
who has been roughly handled by Mātali, Indra’s charioteer, as an effective means
of bringing the king back to the realization that there are duties superior to private
feeling. The gods need his aid for battle. In Act VII Duḥṣanta is revealed victorious,
and travelling with Mātali in a divine car high through the air to Hemakūṭa, where
dwells in the place of supreme bliss the seer Mārīca and his wife. Here the king sees
a gallant boy playfully pulling about a young lion to the terror of two maidens who
accompany him in the dress of the hermitage; they ask the king to intervene with the
child in the cub’s interest, and the king feels a pang as he thinks of his sonlessness.
To his amazement he learns that this is no hermit’s son, but his own; Çakuntalā is
revealed to him in the dress of an ascetic, and Mārīca crowns their happiness by making
it clear to Çakuntalā that her husband was guiltless of the sorrow inflicted upon
her.
</p>
<p>A drama so popular has naturally enough failed to come down to us in a single recension.<a class="noteRef" id="n154.1src" href="#n154.1">25</a> Four are normally distinguished, Bengālī, Devanāgarī, Kāçmīrī, and South Indian,
while a fifth may also be traced. There are, however, in reality, two main recensions,
the Bengālī, with 221 stanzas, as fixed by the commentators Çan̄kara and Candraçekhara,
and the Devanāgarī, with 194 stanzas, of Rāghavabhaṭṭa; the Kāçmīrī, which supplies
an entr’acte to Act VII, is in the main an eclectic combination of these two representatives
of North Indian texts, and the South Indian is closely akin to the Devanāgarī; Abhirāma
and Kāṭayavema among others have commented on it. The evidence of superior merit is
conflicting; Pischel<a class="noteRef" id="n154.2src" href="#n154.2">26</a> laid stress on the more correct Prākrit of the Bengālī and the fact that some readings
in <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>the Devanāgarī are best explained as glosses on the Bengālī text, while Lévi<a class="noteRef" id="n155.1src" href="#n155.1">27</a> proved that Harṣa and Rājaçekhara knew the Bengālī recension in some shape. On the
other hand, Weber<a class="noteRef" id="n155.2src" href="#n155.2">28</a> contended for the priority of the Devanāgarī; certainly some readings there are better,
and some of the Bengālī stanzas are mere repetitions of others found in both texts.
Unless we adopt the not very plausible view of Bollensen that the Devanāgarī version
is the acting edition of the play revised for representation, we must hold that neither
recension is of conclusive value: the argument from the Prākrit is not conclusive,
for it may merely rest on the superior knowledge of the copyists from whom the Bengālī
original ultimately issued.<a class="noteRef" id="n155.3src" href="#n155.3">29</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>Kālidāsa’s Dramatic Art</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The order of plays here adopted is in precise harmony with the development in a harmonious
manner of Kālidāsa’s dramatic art. The <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> is essentially a work of youthful promise and some achievement;<a class="noteRef" id="n155.4src" href="#n155.4">30</a> the theme is one less banal probably in Kālidāsa’s time than it became later when
every Nāṭikā was based on an analogous plot, and there is some skill in the manner
in which the events are interlaced; the Vidūṣaka’s <span class="corr" id="xd32e6614" title="Source: strategems">stratagems</span> to secure his master the sight of his beloved are amusing, and, though Agnimitra
appears mainly as a love-sick hero, the reports of battles and victories reminds us
adequately of his kingly functions and high importance. The most effective characterization,
however, is reserved for the two queens, Dhāriṇī and Irāvatī: the grace and dignity,
and finally the magnanimity of the former, despite just cause for anger, are set off
effectively against the passionate impetuosity of the latter, which leads her to constant
eavesdropping, and to an outbreak against the king, forgetful of his rank and rights.
The heroine is herself but faintly presented, but her friend Kauçikī, who has been
driven by a series of misfortunes to enter the religious life, is a noble <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>figure; she comforts and distracts the mind of Dhāriṇī; she is an authority on the
dance and on the cure for snake bite, and alone among the women she speaks Sanskrit.
The Vidūṣaka is an essential element in the drama, and he plays rather the part of
a friend and confidant of the king than his jester; without his skilled aid Agnimitra
would have languished in vain for his inamorata. But on the other hand he contributes
comparatively little to the comic side of the drama.
</p>
<p>In the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> Kālidāsa shows a marked advance in imagination. We have no precise information of
the source he followed; the story is old, it occurs in an obscure form in the <i>Ṛgveda</i>, and is degraded to sacrificial application in the <i>Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa</i>; it is also found in a number of Purāṇas, and in the <i>Matsya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n156.1src" href="#n156.1">31</a> there is a fairly close parallel to Kālidāsa’s version, for the motif of the nymph’s
transformation into a creeper, instead of a swan, is already present, Purūravas’s
mad search for her is known as well as his rescue of her from a demon. The passionate
and undisciplined love of Urvaçī is happily displayed, but it is somewhat too far
removed from normal life to charm; her magic power to watch her lover unseen and to
overhear his conversation is as unnatural as the singular lack of maternal affection
which induces her to abandon forthwith her child rather than lose her husband; her
love is selfish; she forgets her duty of respect to the gods in her dramatic act,
and her transformation is the direct outcome of a fit of insane jealousy. The hero
sinks to a diminutive stature beside her, and, effective in the extreme as is his
passionate despair in Act IV, his lack of self-restraint and manliness is obvious
and distasteful. The minor characters are handled with comparative lack of success;
the incident of the boy Āyus is forced, and the ending of the drama ineffective and
flat. The Vidūṣaka, however, introduces an element of comedy in the stupidity by which
he allows himself to be cheated out of the name of Urvaçī, and the clumsiness which
permits the nymph’s letter to fall into the hands of the queen. The latter, Auçīnarī,
is a dignified and more attractive figure than the nymph; <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>like Agnimitra in his scene with Irāvatī, Purūravas cuts a sorry figure beside her,
seeing how just cause she had to be vexed at his lack of faith and candour towards
her.
</p>
<p>In the <i>Çakuntalā</i> Kālidāsa handles again with far more perfect art many of the incidents found in his
earlier drama. He does not hesitate to repeat himself; we have in the first and third
Acts the pretty idea of the king in concealment hearing the confidential talk of the
heroine and her friends; the same motif is found in Act III of the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>. Like Urvaçī, Çakuntalā, when she leaves the king, makes a pretext—her foot pricked
by a thorn and her tunic caught by a branch—to delay her going; in the same way both
express their love by letters; the snatching by a bird of the magic stone in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> is paralleled by Mātali’s seizure of the Vidūṣaka in Act VI; Āyus has a peacock to
play with, as the little Bharata a lion, but in each case the comparison is all to
the good of the <i>Çakuntalā</i>. The same maturity is seen in the changes made in the narrative of the <i>Mahābhārata</i><a class="noteRef" id="n157.1src" href="#n157.1">32</a> which the poet had before him. The story there is plain and simple; the king arrives
at the hermitage; the maiden recounts to him her ancestry without false shame; he
proposes marriage; she argues, and, on being satisfied of the legality of a secret
union, agrees on the understanding that her son shall be made heir apparent. The king
goes away; the child grows up, until at the due season the mother, accompanied by
hermits, takes him to court; the hermits leave her, but she is undaunted when the
king out of policy refuses to recognize her; she threatens him with death and taunts
him with her higher birth; finally, a divine voice bids the king consecrate the child,
and he explains that his action was due solely in order to have it made plain that
the child was the rightful prince. This simple tale is transformed; the shy heroine
would not dream of telling her birth; her maidens even are too modest to do more than
hint, and leave the experienced king to guess the rest. Çakuntalā’s dawning love is
depicted with perfect skill; her marriage and its sequel alluded to with delicate
touches. The king’s absurd conduct is now explained; a curse produces it, and for
that curse Çakuntalā was not without responsibility, for she allowed her <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>love to make her forgetful of the essential duty of hospitality and reverence to the
stranger and saint. Before the king she utters no threat but behaves with perfect
dignity, stunned as she is by his repudiation of their love. The king is a worthy
hero, whose devotion to his public duties and heroism are insisted on, and who deserves
by reason of his unselfishness to be reunited with his wife. His love for his son
is charmingly depicted, and, accepting as an Indian must do the validity of the curse,<a class="noteRef" id="n158.1src" href="#n158.1">33</a> his conduct is irreproachable; it is not that he despises the lovely maiden that
he repulses her, but as a pattern of virtue and morality he cannot accept as his wife
one of whom he knows nothing. Çakuntalā’s own love for him is purified by her suffering,
and, when she is finally united to him, she is no longer a mere loving girl, but one
who has suffered tribulation of spirit and gained in depth and beauty of nature.
</p>
<p>The other characters are models of skilful presentation. Kālidāsa here shakes himself
free from the error of presenting any other woman in competition with Çakuntalā; Duḥṣanta
is much married, but though Haṅsavatī deplores his faithlessness he does not meet
her, and, when Vasumatī enters in Act VI, the effect is saved by the entry of the
minister to ask the king to decide a point of law. The Vidūṣaka, who would have ruined
the love idyll, is cleverly dismissed on other business in Act II, while he serves
the more useful end of introducing comic relief; Mātali playfully terrifies him to
rouse the king from his own sorrows. Kaṇva is a delightful figure, the ascetic, without
child, who lavishes on his adopted daughter all the wealth of his deep affection,
and who sends her to her husband with words of tender advice; he is brilliantly contrasted
with the fierce pride and anger of Durvāsas who curses Çakuntalā for what is no more
than a girlish fault, and the solemn majesty of Mārīca, who, though married, has abandoned
all earthly thoughts and enjoys the happiness of release, while yet contemplating
the affairs of the world and intervening to set them in order with purely disinterested
zeal The companions of the heroine are painted with delicate taste; both are devoted
body and soul to their mistress, but Anasūyā is serious and sensible; Priyaṁvadā <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>talkative and gay. There is a contrast between the two hermits who take Çakuntalā
to the court; Çārn̄garava shows the pride and hauteur of his calling, and severely
rebukes the king; Çāradvata is calm and restrained and admonishes him in lieu. Equally
successful is the delineation of the police officers, whose unjust and overbearing
conduct to the fisherman represents the spirit of Indian police from the first appearance
in history. The supernatural, which is in excess in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, is reduced to modest dimensions, and intervenes hardly at all in the play, until
we come to the last Act, where the theory permits and even demands that the marvellous
should be introduced, and the celestial hermitage is a fit place for the reunion of
two lovers severed by so hard a fate. The episode of the ring whose loss prevents
the immediate recognition of the heroine is effectively conceived and woven into the
plot.
</p>
<p>Kālidāsa excels in depicting the emotions of love, from the first suggestion in an
innocent mind to the perfection of passion; he is hardly less expert in pathos; the
fourth Act of the <i>Çakuntalā</i> is a model of tender sorrow, and the loving kindness with which even the trees take
farewell of their beloved one contrasts with the immediate harsh reception which awaits
her at the royal court. Kālidāsa here, as in the fourth Act of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> and in the garden scenes of the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>, displays admirably his love for nature and his power of description of all the stock
elements of Indian scenery, the mango, the Bimba fruit, the Açoka, the lotus, and
his delicate appreciation of the animal world of India. In the last Act of the <i>Çakuntalā</i> also we have the graceful picture of the appearance of the earth viewed in perspective
from the celestial car of Mātali.
</p>
<p>The humour of the Vidūṣaka is never coarse; his fondness for food is admitted; cakes
and sugar suggest themselves to him when the hero admires the moon or is sick of love;
heroics he despises: the king is summarily compared to a thief in his dislike for
discovery; if caught, he should imitate the latter who explains that he was learning
the art of wall breaking. Or again, he is in his contempt for the ladies of his harem
like one sated of sweet dates and desiring the bitter tamarind. Mālavikā is summarily
treated; she is like a cuckoo caught by a cat when Dhāriṇī places her in confinement,
but he is no more respectful <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>of himself, for, seized by Mātali, he treats himself as a mouse in mortal fear of
a cat. Best of all is his description in Act II of the miseries brought on him by
<span class="corr" id="xd32e6695" title="Source: Duḥsanta’s">Duḥṣanta’s</span> hunting; the Brahmins were no admirers of the sport, though they had to acquiesce
in it in kings, and the Vidūṣaka’s picture is vivid in the extreme.
</p>
<p>The range of Kālidāsa’s technical knowledge is apparent in his skilled use of the
dance and song to set off his dramas; the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> contains an interesting exposition by the dancing master of the theory of the art
and its importance; not only is Mālavikā a dancer, but Çakuntalā shows her skill in
movement in Act I. The songs of the trees and of Haṅsavatī in the same play enable
him to add a fresh interest to the drama, and in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> spectacular effects seem to have been aimed at, while in the Bengālī recension song
is prominently introduced in Act IV of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>.
</p>
<p>Admirable as is Kālidāsa’s work, it would be unjust to ignore the fact that in his
dramas as in his epics he shows no interest in the great problems of life and destiny.
The admiration of Goethe and the style of the Shakespeare of India accorded by Sir
William Jones,<a class="noteRef" id="n160.1src" href="#n160.1">34</a> the first to translate the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, are deserved, but must not blind us to the narrow range imposed on Kālidāsa’s interests
by his unfeigned devotion to the Brahmanical creed of his time. Assured, as he was,
that all was governed by a just fate which man makes for himself by his own deeds,
he was incapable of viewing the world as a tragic scene, of feeling any sympathy for
the hard lot of the majority of men, or appreciating the reign of injustice in the
world. It was impossible for him to go beyond his narrow range; we may be grateful
that, confined as he was, he accomplished a work of such enduring merit and universal
appeal as <i>Çakuntalā</i>, which even in the ineffective guise of translations has won general recognition
as a masterpiece.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>The Style</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kālidāsa represents the highest pitch of elegance attained in Sanskrit style of the
elevated Kāvya character; he is master of the Vaidarbha style, the essentials of which
are the absence of <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>compounds or the rare use of them, and harmony of sound as well as clearness, elevation,
and force allied to beauty, such as is conveyed to language by the use of figures
of speech and thought. He is simple, as are Bhāsa and the author of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, but with an elegance and refinement which are not found in these two writers; Açvaghoṣa,
we may be sure, influenced his style, but the chief cause of its perfection must have
been natural taste and constant reworking of what he had written, a fact which may
easily explain the discrepancies between the recensions of his work. But his skill
in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> never leads him into the defect of taste which betrayed his successors into exhibiting
their skill in the wrong place; skilled as he is in description, and ready as he is
to exhibit his power, in the fifth Act he refrains from inserting any of these ornamental
stanzas which add nothing to the action, however much honour they may do to the skill
of the poet. His language has also the merit of suggestiveness; what Bhavabhūti, the
greatest of his successors, expresses at length, he is content to indicate by a touch.
He is admirably clear, and the propriety of his style is no less admirable; the language
of the policeman and the fisher is as delicately nuanced as that of the domestic priest
who argues at once in the best style of the philosophical Sūtras. The Prākrit which
he ascribes to the maidens of his play has the supreme merit that it utterly eschews
elaborate constructions and long compounds, such as Bhavabhūti places without thought
of the utter incongruity in the mouths of simple girls.
</p>
<p>The rhetoricians<a class="noteRef" id="n161.1src" href="#n161.1">35</a> extol the merits of Kālidāsa in metaphor, and they repeatedly cite his skill in the
use of figures of speech, sound and thought, which they divide and subdivide in endless
variety. He excels in vivid description (<i>svabhāvokti</i>) as when he depicts the flight of the antelope which Duḥṣanta pursues to the hermitage:

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Kālidāsa we find the normal state of the Prākrits in the later drama, Çaurasenī
for the prose speeches, and Māhārāṣṭrī for the verses.<a class="noteRef" id="n166.1src" href="#n166.1">52</a> The police officers and the fisher in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> use Māgadhī, but the king’s brother-in-law, who is in charge of the police and is
a faint echo of the Çakāra, speaks, as we have the drama, neither Çākārī nor Māgadhī
nor Dākṣiṇātyā but simply Çaurasenī. By this time, of course, we may assume that Prākrit
for the drama had been stereotyped by the authority of Vararuci’s Prākrit grammar,
and that it differed considerably from the spoken dialect; there would be clear proof
if the Apabhraṅça verses of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> could safely be ascribed to Kālidāsa. The Māhārāṣṭrī unquestionably owes its vogue
to the outburst of lyric in that dialect, which has left its traces in the anthology
of Hāla and later texts, and which about the period of Kālidāsa invaded the epic.<a class="noteRef" id="n166.2src" href="#n166.2">53</a>
</p>
<p>Kālidāsa’s Sanskrit is classical; here and there deviations from the norm are found,
but in most instances the expressions are capable of defence on some rule or other,
while in others we may remember the fact of the epic tradition which is strong in
Bhāsa.
</p>
<p>The metres of Kālidāsa show in the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> a restricted variety; the Āryā (35) and the Çloka (17) are the only metres often
occurring. In the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> the Āryā (29) and the Çloka (30) are almost in equal favour, while the <span class="corr" id="xd32e7051" title="Source: Vasantatilakā">Vasantatilaka</span> (12) and the Çārdūlavikrīḍita (11) make a distinct advance in importance. In the
<i>Çakuntalā</i> the Āryā (38) and Çloka (36) preserve their relative positions, while the Vasantatilaka
(30) and Çārdūlavikrīḍita (22) advance in frequency of use, a striking proof of Kālidāsa’s
growing power of using elaborate metrical forms. The Upajāti types increase to 16.
The other metres used in the drama are none of frequent occurrence; common to all
the dramas are Aparavaktra,<a class="noteRef" id="n166.3src" href="#n166.3">54</a> Aupacchandasika,<a class="noteRef" id="n166.4src" href="#n166.4">55</a> and Vaitālīya, Drutavilambita, Puṣpitāgrā, Pṛthvī, Mandākrāntā, Mālinī, Vaṅçasthā,
Çārdūlavikrīḍita, Çikhariṇī, and Hariṇī; the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>and the <i>Çakuntalā</i> share also Praharṣiṇī, Rucirā,<a class="noteRef" id="n167.1src" href="#n167.1">56</a> Çālinī, and Sragdharā; the latter adds the Rathoddhatā,<a class="noteRef" id="n167.2src" href="#n167.2">57</a> the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> a Mañjubhāṣiṇī.<a class="noteRef" id="n167.3src" href="#n167.3">58</a> The earliest play has one irregular Prākrit verse, the second two Āryās, and 29 of
varied form of the types measured by feet or morae, and the last seven Āryās and two
Vaitālīyas. The predominance of the Āryā is interesting, for it is essentially a Prākrit
metre, whence it seems to have secured admission into Sanskrit verse.
</p>
<p>Not unnaturally, efforts<a class="noteRef" id="n167.4src" href="#n167.4">59</a> have been made on the score of metre to ascertain the dates of the plays <i lang="la">inter se</i>, and in relation to the rest of the acknowledged work of Kālidāsa. The result achieved
by Dr. Huth would place the works in the order <i>Raghuvaṅça</i>, <i>Meghadūta</i>, <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>, <i>Çakuntalā</i>, <i>Kumārasambhava</i>, and <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>. But the criteria are quite inadequate; the <i>Meghadūta</i> has but one metre, the Mandākrāntā, which occurs so seldom in the other poems and
plays that any comparison is impossible,<a class="noteRef" id="n167.5src" href="#n167.5">60</a> and the points relied upon by Dr. Huth are of minimal importance; they assume such
doctrines as that the poem which contains the fewest abnormal caesuras is the more
metrically perfect and therefore the later, while the poem which has the largest number
of abnormal forms of the Çloka metre is artistically the more perfect and so later.
A detailed investigation of the different forms of abnormal caesuras reveals the most
perplexing counter-indications of relative date, and the essential impression produced
by the investigations is that Kālidāsa was a finished metrist, who did not seriously
alter his metrical forms at any period of his career as revealed in his poems, and
that there is no possibility of deducing any satisfactory conclusions from metrical
evidence. The fact that the evidence would place the mature and meditative <i>Raghuvaṅça</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n167.6src" href="#n167.6">61</a> which bears within it unmistakable proofs of the author’s old age, before the <i>Meghadūta</i> and long before the <i>Kumārasambhava</i>, both redolent of love and youth, is sufficient to establish its total untrustworthiness.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some mystery exists as to the identity and character of Candra as a dramatist.<a class="noteRef" id="n168.1src" href="#n168.1">1</a> We have in a Tibetan version a <i>Lokānanda</i>, a Buddhist drama telling of a certain Maṇicūḍa, who handed over his wife and children
to a Brahmin as a sign of supreme generosity, which is ascribed to Candragomin, the
grammarian, in whose <i>Çiṣyalekhā</i> is found a verse ascribed to Candragopin in the <i>Subhāṣitāvali</i>. If this is the dramatist Candaka or Candraka, who is placed by Kalhaṇa under Tuñjina
of Kashmir, and who rivalled the author of the <i>Mahābhārata</i> in a drama, is wholly uncertain. The grammarian must have lived before <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 650, as he is cited in the <i>Kāçikā Vṛtti</i> though not by name; a more precise date it is impossible to give, for his reference
to a victory of a Jarta over the Hūṇas cannot be made precise until we know what Jāṭ
prince is referred to, though Yaçodharman has been suggested. The identification by
Lévi of Candra with a person of that name mentioned by I-Tsing as living in his time
is seemingly impossible, though I-Tsing ascribes to him the verse found in the <i>Çiṣyalekhā</i> mentioned above; the verse is lacking in the Tibetan version and I-Tsing may have
made a slip. His contemporary seems to have been a Candradāsa, and to have dramatized
the Viçvantara legend.
</p>
<p>To Candaka is ascribed in the <i>Subhāṣitāvali</i><a class="noteRef" id="n168.2src" href="#n168.2">2</a> a fine verse of martial tone:

<p class="first">‘I go to battle, and I swear that my foes shall never see the backs of my steeds;
for the rest, fate directs the destiny of the wavering fight; I promise nothing, but
shall take defeat or victory as it pleases destiny.’ A verse of love is:<a class="noteRef" id="n169.1src" href="#n169.1">3</a>

let thy speech pour ambrosia upon them. Turn to me for a moment thy face, the abode
of happiness; foolish one, time is an antelope which, gone, cannot be recalled.’ The
other citations we have show skill both in tragic and erotic sentiment.
</p>
<p>Candraka was evidently admired by the authorities on poetics; we find in the commentary
on the <i>Daçarūpa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n169.2src" href="#n169.2">4</a> a verse, elsewhere ascribed to him, cited as an example where diverse sentiments
blend but where one, that of coming parting of lovers, is predominant:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>ekenākṣṇā paritataruṣā vīkṣate vyomasaṁstham</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>bhānor bimbaṁ sajalalulitenāpareṇātmakāntam</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>ahnaç chede dayitavirahāçan̄kinī cakravākī</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>dvau saṁkīrṇau racayati rasau nartakīva pragalbhā.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘With one angry eye she gazes on the orb of the sun as it tarries on the horizon;
with the other, dimmed by her tears, she looks on her soul’s beloved; thus the mate
of the Cakravāka, feeling the approach at nightfall of separation from her dear one,
expresses two emotions, even as a clever actress.’
</p>
<p>Curiously enough we have no less than four stanzas of benediction ascribed to him,
which illustrate a formal feature of the Sanskrit drama, the introduction of each
play with one or more stanzas involving divine favour. The verses are interesting,
not so much for the intrinsic merits of their poetry, which frankly are not great,
but because of the curious manner in which Indian poetry treats its deities; the greatest
of gods nevertheless in his sportive moods is yet made the prototype of the human
lover:<a class="noteRef" id="n169.3src" href="#n169.3">5</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Authorship of the Dramas ascribed to Harṣa</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Three dramas, as well as some minor poetry, have come down to us under the name of
Harṣa, unquestionably the king of Sthāṇvīçvara and Kanyakubja, who reigned from about
<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 606 to 648,<a class="noteRef" id="n170.2src" href="#n170.2">7</a> the patron of Bāṇa who celebrates him in the <i>Harṣacarita</i> and of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuan-Tsang who is our most valuable source of information
on his reign. That the three plays are by one and the same hand is made certain in
part by the common ascription in a verse in the prologue mentioning Harṣa as an accomplished
poet, partly by the recurrence of two verses in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> and the <i>Nāgānanda</i> and of one in the former play and the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, and above all by the absolute similarity of style and tone in the three works, which
renders any effort to <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>dissociate them wholly impossible. The question of their actual authorship was raised
in antiquity; for, while Mammaṭa in his <i>Kāvyaprakāça</i><a class="noteRef" id="n171.1src" href="#n171.1">8</a> merely refers to the gift of gold to Bāṇa—or Dhāvaka in some manuscripts—by Harṣa,
the commentators explain this of the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, which was passed off in Harṣa’s name. This is, however, not in any way borne out
by early tradition; I-Tsing<a class="noteRef" id="n171.2src" href="#n171.2">9</a> clearly refers to the dramatization of the subject of the <i>Nāgānanda</i> by Harṣa and its performance, and in the <i>Kuṭṭanīmata</i><a class="noteRef" id="n171.3src" href="#n171.3">10</a> of Dāmodaragupta, who lived under Jayāpīḍa of Kashmir (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 779–813), a performance of the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, ascribed to a king, is mentioned. The ascription to Bāṇa has nothing even plausible
in it, so disparate are the styles of the dramas and the <i>Harṣacarita</i>, and we have the option of believing that Harṣa wrote them himself with such aid
as his Paṇḍits might give, or of accepting them as the work of some unknown dramatist,
who allowed the king to claim the credit for them.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>The Three Dramas</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Ratnāvalī</i> and the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> are closely connected both in subject-matter and form; they are Nāṭikās, each in
four Acts; their common hero is Udayana, whom Bhāsa already celebrated, and the common
theme one of his numerous amourettes. The <i>Ratnāvalī</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n171.4src" href="#n171.4">11</a> in special, has found favour in the text-books of the drama, and has served to illustrate
the technical rules.
</p>
<p>The ubiquitous Yaugandharāyaṇa, insatiable in seeking his master’s welfare, has planned
marriage for him with the daughter of the king of Ceylon, but to attain this end has
been difficult; to avoid vexing the queen Vāsavadattā, he has kept her in the dark,
and has spread a rumour which he has had conveyed by Bābhravya, the king’s chamberlain,
of the death of Vāsavadattā in a fire at Lāvāṇaka. The king of Ceylon then yields
the hand of his daughter, and dispatches her in the care of the chamberlain and his
minister Vasubhūti to Vatsa, but, wrecked at sea, she is rescued by a merchant of
Kauçāmbī, taken there, and handed <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>over to Vāsavadattā who, seeing her beauty, decides to keep her from contact with
her inconstant spouse. But fate is adverse; at the spring festival which she celebrates
with Vatsa, Sāgarikā, as the princess is called from her rescue from the sea, appears
in the queen’s train; hastily sent away, she lingers concealed, watches the ceremony
of the worship of the god Kāma, thinking Vatsa is the god in bodily presence, but
is undeceived by the eulogy of the herald announcing the advent of evening. In Act
II Sāgarikā is presented with her friend Susaṁgatā; she has depicted the prince on
a canvas, and Susaṁgatā in raillery adds her beside him; she admits her love, but
the confidence is broken by the alarm created by the escape of a monkey from the stables.
In its mad rush it breaks the cage in Sāgarikā’s keeping, and the parrot escapes.
The king and the Vidūṣaka enter the grove where the bird is, hear it repeat the maidens’
talk, and find the picture. The maidens returning for the picture overhear the confidences
of the king and the Vidūṣaka, until Susaṁgatā sallies out and brings the lovers face
to face. Their meeting is cut short by the advent of the queen, who sees the picture,
realizes the position, and departs without manifesting the deep anger which she feels
and which the king vainly seeks to assuage. In Act III the Vidūṣaka proves to have
devised a scheme to secure a meeting of the lovers; Sāgarikā dressed as the queen
and Susaṁgatā as her attendant are to meet Vatsa, but the plot is overheard, and it
is Vāsavadattā herself who keeps the rendezvous; she listens to Vatsa’s declarations
of love, and then bitterly reproaches him, rejecting his attempts to excuse himself.
Sāgarikā, who had come on the scene too late, hears the king’s plight; weary, she
ties a noose to her neck, when she is saved by the advent of the Vidūṣaka and the
king, who naturally mistakes her for Vāsavadattā whom he fears his cruelty has driven
to suicide. He joyously recognizes his error, but the queen, who, ashamed of her anger,
has returned to make friends with her husband, finds the lovers united, and in violent
anger carries off the maiden and the Vidūṣaka captive. But in Act IV we find the Vidūṣaka
released and forgiven, but Sāgarikā in some prison, the king helpless to aid her.
Good news, however, arrives; the general Rumaṇvant has won a victory over the Kosalas
and slain the king. A magician enters and is allowed to display his art, <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>but the spectacle is interrupted by the advent of Vasubhūti and Bābhravya, who also
have escaped the shipwreck. They tell their tale of disaster, when another interruption
occurs; the harem is on fire; Vāsavadattā, shocked, reveals that Sāgarikā is there;
Vatsa rushes to aid her, and emerges with her in chains, for the fire has been no
more than a device of the magician. Bābhravya and Vasubhūti recognize in Sāgarikā
the princess, and Yaugandharāyaṇa arrives to confess his management of the whole plot
and the magician’s device. Vāsavadattā gladly gives the king to Ratnāvalī, since her
husband will thus be lord of the earth, and Ratnāvalī is her full cousin.
</p>
<p>The <i>Priyadarçikā</i><a class="noteRef" id="n173.1src" href="#n173.1">12</a> introduces us in a speech by his chamberlain, Vinayavasu, to the king Dṛḍhavarman,
whose daughter is destined for wedlock with Vatsa despite the demand for her hand
made by the king of Kalin̄ga, who revenges himself during Vatsa’s imprisonment at
the court of Pradyota by attacking and driving away Dṛḍhavarman. The maid is carried
away by the chamberlain and is received and sheltered by Vindhyaketu, her father’s
ally, but he offends Vatsa, is attacked and killed by his general Vijayasena, who
brings back as part of the booty the unlucky Priyadarçikā; the king allots her to
the harem as attendant on Vāsavadattā with the name Āraṇyikā (Āraṇyakā). In Act II
we find the king, who has fallen in love with the maiden, seeking to distract himself
with his Vidūṣaka. Āraṇyikā enters, to pluck lotuses, with her friend; she tells her
love, which the king overhears; a bee attacks her when her friend leaves her, and
in her confusion she runs into the arms of the king. Vatsa rescues her, but retires
when her confidante returns. Act III tells that the aged confidante of the queen,
Sāṁkṛtyāyanī, has composed a play on the marriage of Vatsa and Vāsavadattā which the
queen is to see performed; the rôle of queen is to be played by Āraṇyikā, and Manoramā
is to act the part of king, but she and the Vidūṣaka have arranged to let the king
take the part. The performance causes anxiety to the queen, so ardent is the love-making,
though Sāṁkṛtyāyanī reminds her it is but play-making; she leaves the hall, and finds
the Vidūṣaka asleep; rudely wakened, he lets out the secret and the queen refuses
to listen to <span class="corr" id="xd32e7368" title="Source: Vatsas’s">Vatsa’s</span> lame excuses. Act IV reveals Āraṇyikā in <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>prison, the king in despair, and the queen in sorrow, as she has learned from a letter
from her mother that Dṛḍhavarman, her aunt’s husband, is in bondage, needing Vatsa’s
aid. But Vijayasena brings news of the defeat of the Kalin̄ga king and the re-establishment
of Dṛḍhavarman, and the chamberlain of the latter brings his thanks, his one sorrow
being his daughter’s loss. Manoramā enters in terror; Āraṇyikā has poisoned herself,
Vāsavadattā, filled with remorse, has her fetched, as Vatsa can cure her; the chamberlain
recognizes his princess, Vatsa’s magic arts bring her back to consciousness, and Vāsavadattā
recognizes in her her cousin, and grants her hand to the king.
</p>
<p>The <i>Nāgānanda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n174.1src" href="#n174.1">13</a> performed at a festival of Indra, perhaps in the autumn, differs from these dramas
in its form, for it is a Nāṭaka in five Acts, and in its inspiration; those are variants
by Harṣa on the theme of Vatsa’s loves, this is the dramatization of a Buddhist legend,
the self-sacrifice of Jīmūtavāhana, which was told in the <i>Bṛhatkathā</i>, whence it appears in the later versions of that text<a class="noteRef" id="n174.2src" href="#n174.2">14</a> and in the <i>Vetālapañcaviṅçati</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n174.3src" href="#n174.3">15</a> Jīmūtavāhana is a prince of the Vidyādharas, who <span class="corr" id="xd32e7390" title="Source: hasinduced">has induced</span> his father to resign his kingship, and give himself up to a life of calm; he has
made the acquaintance of Mitrāvasu, the prince of the Siddhas, who has a sister. She
has had a dream in which Gaurī has revealed to her her future husband, and Jīmūtavāhana
hidden behind a thicket overhears her confiding this dream to her friend; the Vidūṣaka
forces a meeting on the timid lovers, who shyly confess their affection, when an ascetic
from the hermitage arrives to take the maiden away. In Act II Malayavatī is love-sick,
resting on a stone seat in the garden; a sound makes her move away, when the king
enters, equally oppressed, declares his love and paints his fancy. Mitrāvasu comes
to offer him his sister’s hand; the king declines it, ignorant of whom he loves; she
deems herself disdained and seeks to hang herself, but her friends rescue her and
call for aid. Jīmūtavāhana appears, and proves that she is his love by showing the
picture. The two exchange vows, and the marriage is concluded. In Act III, after a
comic interlude, we find them walking in the park in happiness; Jīmūtavāhana is <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>apprised of the seizure of his kingdom, but accepts the news gladly. But the last
two Acts change the topic. While strolling with Mitrāvasu one day, Jīmūtavāhana sees
a heap of bones and learns that they are the bones of serpents daily offered to the
divine bird Garuḍa; he resolves to save the lives of the serpents at the cost of his
own, gets rid of Mitrāvasu, and goes to the place of offering. He hears the sobs of
the mother of Çan̄khacūḍa, whose son is about to be offered, consoles her by offering
himself in ransom, but is refused with admiration for his gallantry. But, when the
two have entered the temple to pray before the offering, he gives himself to Garuḍa
as substitute and is borne away. The last Act opens with the anxiety of the parents
of Jīmūtavāhana, to whom and his wife is borne a jewel fallen from his crown; Çan̄khacūḍa,
also, emerged from the temple, finds the sacrifice made and reveals to Garuḍa his
crime. It is too late; the hero expires as his parents arrive. Garuḍa is ashamed,
and Gaurī appears to cut the knot, revive the prince, and re-establish him in his
realm, in order to keep faith with Malayavatī; by a shower of ambrosia the snakes
slain by Garuḍa revive, and he promises to forego his cruel revenge.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>Harṣa’s Art and Style</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Comparison with Kālidāsa is doubtless the cause why Harṣa has tended to receive less
praise than is due to his dramas. The originality of his Nāṭikās is not perhaps great,
but he has effectively devised the plot in both; the action moves smoothly and in
either play there is ingenuity. The scene of the magician’s activity in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> is depicted with humour and vivacity; the parrot’s escape and its chatter are sketched
with piquancy, and the exchange of costumes in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> is natural and effective. The double comedy in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> is a happy thought, the intrigue in Act IV is neatly conducted, so as to show us
Vāsavadattā in the light of an affectionate niece, and the scene with the bee is attractive.
It is true that the plays are full of reminiscences of the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>, such as the escape in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> of the monkey, and the monkey that there frightens the little princess while Sāṁkṛtyāyanī
is Kauçikī revived. But in this artificial comedy elegance is sought, not <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>originality,<a class="noteRef" id="n176.1src" href="#n176.1">16</a> and Harṣa is a clever borrower. The similarity of development of both plays is perhaps
more to be condemned; they are too obviously variations of one theme.
</p>
<p>The dominant emotion in either is love of the type which appertains to a noble and
gay (<i>dhīralalita</i>) hero, who is always courteous, whose loves, that is to say, mean very little to
him, and who does not forget to assure the old love of his devotion while playing
with the new. This is a different aspect of Vatsa’s character from that displayed
by Bhāsa, and admittedly a much inferior one. Vāsavadattā suffers equal deterioration,
for she is no longer the wife who sacrifices herself for her husband’s good; she is
rather a jealous, though noble and kind-hearted woman, whose love for her husband
makes her resent too deeply his inconstancy. The heroines are <i>ingénues</i> with nothing but good looks and willingness to be loved by the king, whom they know,
though he does not, to be destined by their fathers as their husband. In neither case
is any adequate reason<a class="noteRef" id="n176.2src" href="#n176.2">17</a> suggested for the failure to declare themselves in their true character, unless we
are to assume that they would not, in the absence of sponsors, have been believed.
Susaṁgatā, the friend of the heroine in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, is a pleasant, merry girl who makes excellent fun of her mistress. The Vidūṣaka<a class="noteRef" id="n176.3src" href="#n176.3">18</a> in both plays is typical in his greediness, but his figure lacks comic force; he
is, however, a pleasant enough character, for his love for his master is genuine;
he is prepared to die with him in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, though he thinks his action in rushing into the fire quixotic. The magician is an
amusing and clever sketch of great pretensions allied to some juggling skill.
</p>
<p>The <i>Nāgānanda</i> reveals Harṣa in a new light in the last two Acts. His liking for the marvellous
is exhibited indeed in the last Acts of both the Nāṭikās in accord with the theory,
but it has a far wider scope in the <i>Nāgānanda</i>, where the supernatural freely appears, and, though the drama be Buddhist in inspiration,
Gaurī is introduced to solve the difficulty of restoring <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>Jīmūtavāhana. Harṣa here rises to the task of depicting the emotions of self-sacrifice,
charity, magnanimity, and resolution in the face of death; Jīmūtavāhana, however bizarre
his setting, is one of the ideals of Buddhism, a man seized with the conviction that
to sacrifice oneself for others is the highest duty. Çan̄khacūḍa and his mother too
appear as noble in character, far superior to the savage Garuḍa. There is, it must
be admitted, a decided lack of harmony between the two distinct parts of the drama,
but the total effect is far from unsuccessful. Perhaps as a counterpoise to the seriousness
of the last part, Harṣa has introduced effective comedy in Act III. The Vidūṣaka,
Ātreya, is hideous and stupid; as he lies sleeping, covered by a mantle to protect
him from the bees, the Viṭa, Çekharaka, sees him, mistakes him for his inamorata,
embraces him and fondles him. Navamālikā enters, and, indignant, the Viṭa makes the
Vidūṣaka, though a Brahmin, bow before her and drink alcohol. A little later Navamālikā
makes fun of him before the newly married couple by painting his face with Tamūla
juice.
</p>
<p>Harṣa is fond of descriptions in the approved manner; the evening, midday, the park,
the hermitage, the gardens, the fountain, the marriage festival, the hour for the
bath, the mountain Malaya, the forest, the palace, are among the ordinary themes beloved
in the Kāvya. In imagination and grace he is certainly inferior to Kālidāsa, but he
possesses the great merit of simplicity of expression and thought; his Sanskrit is
classical, and precise; his use of figures of speech and thought restrained and in
good taste. There is fire in his description of a battle:<a class="noteRef" id="n177.1src" href="#n177.1">19</a>

Such a phrase may reveal to us the true Harṣa himself, the winner of many victories,
and the hero of one great disaster.
</p>
<p>The <i>Nāgānanda</i> strikes varied notes; there is fire and enthusiasm in the assurances which Mitrāvasu
gives the prince of the swift overthrow of his enemy, Matan̄ga, at the hands of his
faithful Siddhas, will he but give the word:<a class="noteRef" id="n178.4src" href="#n178.4">23</a>

</p>
<p>Jīmūtavāhana, however, has other views of his duty:<a class="noteRef" id="n179.1src" href="#n179.1">24</a>

<p class="first">‘Gladly, unasked, would I give my own life for another in compassion; how then could
I consent to the cruel slaughter of men merely to win a realm?’ The saying is essential
to the drama, for it leads immediately to the determination of the prince to sacrifice
himself for the Nāga.
</p>
<p>There is dignity and force in the admonition addressed by the dying hero to the repentant
Garuḍa who begs him to command him:<a class="noteRef" id="n179.2src" href="#n179.2">25</a>

</p>
<p>Though Buddhist the drama, the benediction is enough to show how effectively the spirit
of the Nāṭikā has been introduced into the legend:<a class="noteRef" id="n179.3src" href="#n179.3">26</a>

be any man more pitiless than thou?” May he, whom Māra’s beauties thus addressed,
the Buddha, the conqueror, protect you.’
</p>
<p>But Harṣa’s chief merit is undoubtedly shown in erotic verses as in the description
of the shyness of the new-made bride in the <i>Nāgānanda</i>:<a class="noteRef" id="n180.1src" href="#n180.1">28</a>

<div lang="und" class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">‘Mind is naturally mobile and hard to find; nevertheless mine has been pierced by
love at once with all his darts.’ In entire harmony with Indian taste Harṣa dwells
on the points of physical perfection in the adored one in the <i>Nāgānanda</i>:<a class="noteRef" id="n180.3src" href="#n180.3">30</a>

<div lang="und" class="lgouter">

Harṣa is also capable of expressing a deeper side of love, as when the king in the

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> <i>The Language and the Metres of Harṣa’s Dramas</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Harṣa’s Sanskrit is of the usual classical type, eschewing any deviation from the
beaten paths, and his Prākrits, mainly Çaurasenī with Māhārāṣṭrī in the verses, offer
nothing of special interest, beyond evidence of his careful study of Prākrit grammar.<a class="noteRef" id="n181.1src" href="#n181.1">32</a>
</p>
<p>His use of metrical forms, on the other hand, marks the tendency to reject the simplicity
of the earlier dramatists, and to insist on the use of the more elaborate metres,
which in themselves are wholly undramatic, but give a much wider range of opportunity
for the exhibition of merits of description. Harṣa’s favourite is the Çārdūlavikrīḍita,
which occurs 23 times in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, 20 times in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i>, and 30 times in the <i>Nāgānanda</i>; the Sragdharā takes second place with 11, 8, and 17 occurrences. The Çloka occurs
in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> (9)<span id="xd32e7701"></span> and the Nāgānanda (24), the frequency in the latter being due to the more epic character
of the piece; its absence from the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> is marked. The Āryā occurs 9 times each in the Nāṭikās, and 16 times in the <i>Nāgānanda</i>. The <i>Priyadarçikā</i> suggests by its content immaturity, and its poverty in metres supports this view;
it has but seven in all, including Indravajrā, Vasantatilaka (6), Mālinī, and Çikhariṇī.
The <i>Nāgānanda</i> has also Çālinī and Hariṇī, in common with the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, and Drutavilambita, while the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> adds Puṣpitāgrā, Pṛthvī, and Praharṣiṇī. That play has 5 Prākrit Āryās and 1 Gīti,
the other two 3 Āryās apiece, while the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> contains a pretty pair of rhymed verses, each with Pādas of 12 morae.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span> </p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">6.</span> <i>Mahendravikramavarman</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Almost a contemporary to a day of Harṣa was Mahendravikramavarman, son of the Pallava
king Siṅhaviṣṇuvarman, and himself a king with the styles of Avanibhājana, Guṇabhara,
and Mattavilāsa, all alluded to in his play,<a class="noteRef" id="n182.1src" href="#n182.1">33</a> who ruled in Kāñcī, the scene of his drama, in the first quarter of the seventh century
<span class="asc">A.D.</span><a class="noteRef" id="n182.2src" href="#n182.2">34</a> Chance rather than any special merit has preserved for us his Prahasana,<a class="noteRef" id="n182.3src" href="#n182.3">35</a> which is so far the only early farce published, and which has special interest as
it comes from the south, and, as we have seen, shows signs of the same technique as
that of Bhāsa. Thus the play is opened by the director at the close of the Nāndī,
which is not preserved, and the prologue is styled Sthāpanā, and not, as usual, Prastāvanā.
We have also a reference to Karpaṭa as the writer of a text-book for thieves, as in
the <i>Cārudatta</i> of Bhāsa, but there is an essential difference in the fact that great care is taken
in the prologue to set out at length the merits of the author as well as the name
of the drama.
</p>
<p>The director introduces the play by a dialogue in which he by skilled flattery induces
his first wife to aid him in the work, despite her annoyance at his taking to himself
of a younger bride, and the transition to the actual drama is accomplished as in Bhāsa
by his being interrupted in the midst of a verse by a cry from behind the scene, which
leads him to complete his stanza by mentioning the appearance of the chief actor and
his companion. They are a Çaiva mendicant of the skull-bearing order, a Kapālin, and
his damsel, Devasomā by name. Both are intoxicated, and the maiden asks for her companion’s
aid to prevent her from falling; he would hold her if he could, but his own condition
hinders aid; in remorse he proposes to forswear strong drink, but the lady entreats
him not for her sake thus to break <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>his penance, and he joyfully abandons the rash project, praising instead his rule
of life:<a class="noteRef" id="n183.1src" href="#n183.1">36</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>peyā surā priyatamāmukham īkṣitavyam: grāhyaḥ svabhāvalalito ’vikṛtaç ca veṣaḥ</i> </p>

</div>
<p class="first">‘Long live the god who bears the trident and who has revealed to men this as the way
of salvation, to drink brandy, to gaze on the face of one’s beloved, to wear beautiful
and becoming raiment.’ He is reminded by his companions that the Arhants have a very
different definition of the path of salvation, but he has little trouble in disposing
of them:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>kāryasya niḥsaṁçayam ātmahetoḥ: sarūpatāṁ hetubhir abhyupetya</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>duḥkhasya kāryaṁ sukham āmanantaḥ: svenaiva vākyena hatā varākāḥ.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘They establish that an effect, as self-caused, is of the same nature as its causes;
when, therefore, they declare that pleasure is the effect of pain, the poor fools
contradict their own dogmas.’ There follows a complimentary description of Kāñcī,
and a careful parallel between the tavern where the pair are seeking more charity
and a scene of sacrifice; the Kapālin also discovers that Surā has a celestial origin;
it is none other than the form taken by the god of love when burnt by the flame from
Çiva’s eye, a conclusion heartily accepted by his friend. The two are successful in
attaining alms, but the tragic discovery is made that the skull, which serves as begging
bowl, and which seems indeed at first to be the <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i> of the Kapālin, is lost, though he consoles himself by reflecting that it was only
a sign and that his occupation is still intact. A search through Kāñcī follows, and
suspicion falls on a Buddhist monk, Çākyabhikṣu, who is lamenting the fact that despite
the excellent fare he has received the law forbids the enjoyment of strong drink and
women; he concludes that the true gospel of the Buddha contained no such ridiculous
restrictions, and expresses his desire to benefit the whole community by discovering
the authentic text. <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>Naturally, when challenged, he denies that his begging bowl is that of the Kapālin,
and blesses the master for his good sense in insisting on shaving the head, since
it prevents the damsel from succeeding in her well-meant effort to aid her companion
by pulling his hair. His arguments as to the identity of his bowl are unconvincing
to the Kapālin:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>dṛṣṭāni vastūni mahīsamudra—: mahīdharādīni mahānti mohāt</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>apahnuvānasya sutaḥ kathaṁ tvam: alpaṁ na nihnotum alaṁ kapālam?</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Thou art the son of one who denies in his folly things that we see, the earth, the
ocean, mountains and so forth; how then art thou not ready to deny so small a thing
as a bowl?’ Moreover, when the Buddhist, politely and with commendable charity, picks
up Devasomā when her fruitless assault on his locks lands her on the ground, he accuses
him of taking her in marriage and invokes punishment on this violator of the rights
of Brahmins. A Pāçupata, a more respectable type of Çaiva sectarian, comes on the
scene and is appealed to as an arbitrator, but finds the task too difficult; both
claimants proudly assert their adherence to a creed which forbids lying, and the Buddhist
recites in addition the whole list of moral rules which makes up the Çikṣāpada. The
obvious arguments from colour and shape in favour of the Buddhist are made out by
his rival to be no more than signs of his skill in changing objects at pleasure. Finally
the Pāçupata suggests that they must take the matter before a court. <i>En route</i>, however, a diversion is made by an Unmattaka, or madman, who has rescued the skull
from a dog, the real thief; he first appears willing to give it as a present to the
Pāçupata, who haughtily rejects the horrible object, but suggests the Kapālin as the
recipient; then he changes his mind, but, annoyed by the cry of ‘mad’, asks the Kapālin
to hold the skull and to show him the madman; the Kapālin, nothing loth, accepts the
skull, and misdirects the madman. All are now happy; the Kapālin makes a handsome
apology to the Buddhist monk, and the usual Bharatavākya with a reference to the ruling
king, the author, concludes the work.
</p>
<p>The author undoubtedly shows a considerable knowledge of the tenets of the Buddhists,
and the play is not unamusing, <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>though the subject is much too trivial for the pains taken to deal with it. The style
is certainly appropriate to the subject-matter; it is like that of Harṣa, simple and
elegant, while many of the verses are not without force and beauty. In the prose speeches
of the Kapālin, however, we have occasional premonitions<a class="noteRef" id="n185.1src" href="#n185.1">37</a> of the unwieldy compounds of Bhavabhūti. There is, as in all the later Prahasanas,
a certain incongruity between the triviality of the subject-matter and the elaboration
of the form but the king has the merit of avoiding the gross vulgarity which marks
normally the later works of this type.
</p>
<p>Short as is the play, it shows a variety of Prākrits, for of the <i lang="la">dramatis personae</i> only the Kapālin and the Pāçupata speak Sanskrit, while the madman, the Buddhist,
and Devasomā talk in Prākrit. That of the Buddhist and of Devasomā is practically
Çaurasenī, but the madman uses Māgadhī.<a class="noteRef" id="n185.2src" href="#n185.2">38</a> The Prākrits show some of the signs of antiquity which have been seen in Bhāsa’s
dramas; thus forms of the plural in <i>āṇi</i> and <i>ññ</i> in lieu of <i>ṇṇ</i> are found, doubtless as a result of the influence of Bhāsa. The frequency of such
forms as <i lang="und">aho nu khalu</i> and <i lang="und">kiṁ nu khalu</i> is precisely in the manner of Bhāsa, and mention may be made of the employment of
<i lang="und">mā</i> with the infinitive in Prākrit in a prohibition.

<p>The variety of metres is large in view of the brief extent of the play. There are
nine different stanzas employed; five each of the Çloka and Çārdūlavikrīḍita, three
each of Indravajrā type and Āryā, two each of Vaṅçasthā type and Vasantatilaka, the
solitary Prākrit verse being of the former kind, and one each of Rucirā, Mālinī, and
Sragdharā.<a class="noteRef" id="n185.3src" href="#n185.3">39</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bhavabhūti tells us in his prologues that he belonged to a family of Brahmins styled
Udumbaras, of Padmapura, apparently in Vidarbha, who were of the Kāçyapa Gotra and
followed the Taittirīya school of the Black Yajurveda. His full name was Çrīkaṇṭha
Nīlakaṇṭha, son of Nīlakaṇṭha and Jātūkarṇī, grandson of Bhaṭṭa Gopāla, fifth in descent
from Mahākavi, a Vājapeya sacrificer, famed for his scholarship. He was skilled in
grammar, rhetoric, and logic, or perhaps in grammar, logic, and Mīmāṅsā,<a class="noteRef" id="n186.1src" href="#n186.1">1</a> if we may believe the legend that he was a pupil of Kumārila preserved in one manuscript
of the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>, which complicates the matter by styling the author also Umvekācārya, a commentator
on Kumārila’s works. As he expressly mentions his knowledge of the Vedas, the Upaniṣads,
Sāṁkhya and Yoga, and gives Jñānanidhi as his teacher, we may probably discard this
suggestion. The whole three of his plays were performed for the feast of the Lord
Kālapriya, who is normally identified with Mahākāla of Ujjayinī, though the scene
of the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> is laid in Padmāvatī. We may conjecture, therefore, that he left his home and proceeded
to Ujjayinī or Padmāvatī in search of fortune. From the silence in his dramas on any
good luck, it is strange to find that Kalhaṇa in the <i>Rājataran̄giṇī</i><a class="noteRef" id="n186.2src" href="#n186.2">2</a> expressly asserted that he was a member of the entourage of Yaçovarman of Kanyakubja,
who was defeated by Muktāpīḍa Lalitāditya of Kashmir, not earlier, probably, than
<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 736. A further indication of date is afforded by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>reference in Vākpati’s <i>Gaüḍavaha</i><a class="noteRef" id="n187.1src" href="#n187.1">3</a> to Bhavabhūti’s ocean of poetry; the poem is a prelude to a description in Prākrit
of Yaçovarman’s defeat of a Gauḍa king, and, as it seems never to have been finished,
it presumably was interrupted by the king’s own defeat. We must, therefore, place
Bhavabhūti somewhere about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 700. The silence of Bāṇa regarding him suggests that he was not known to him, while
it is certain that he knew Kālidāsa; the first writer on poetics to cite him is Vāmana.<a class="noteRef" id="n187.2src" href="#n187.2">4</a> Verses not in our extant dramas are ascribed to him, so he may have written other
works than the three dramas, two Nāṭakas on the Rāma legend and a Prakaraṇa, which
we have. His friendship with actors is a trait to which he himself refers, and efforts
have been made to trace in his works evidence of revision for stage purposes.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Three Plays</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Perhaps the earliest of the works is the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i>, but the evidence for this is uncertain, and there is no reason to assign it definitely
to an earlier date than the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>; both antedate, perhaps considerably, the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i>. The <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n187.3src" href="#n187.3">5</a> as a Prakaraṇa, should have a plot invented by the author, and this is true to the
extent that the combination of elements which make up the intrigue is clearly the
poet’s, though the main motif of the story and the chief episodes can all be paralleled
in the Kathā literature even as we have it.
</p>
<p>Bhūrivasu, minister of the king of Padmāvatī, has asked an old friend, now turned
nun, Kāmandakī, to arrange a marriage between his daughter, Mālatī, and Mādhava, son
of an old friend Devarāta, minister of the king of Vidarbha, who has sent his son
to Padmāvatī, mainly in the hope that Bhūrivasu would remember a compact of their
student days to marry their children to each other. The obstacle in the way is the
desire of <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>Nandana, the king’s boon companion (<i>narmasuhṛd</i>), to wed Mālatī with the king’s approval. Kāmandakī, therefore, decides to arrange
the meeting of the young people and their marriage, so as to be able to present the
king with a <i lang="fr">fait accompli</i>. Both hero and heroine have friends, Makaranda and Madayantikā, sister of Nandana,
and, after Acts I and II have made the main lovers sufficiently enamoured, in Act
III, when the lovers are meeting in a temple of Çiva, Madayantikā is in danger of
death from an escaped tiger, and is rescued by Makaranda, not without injury. These
two then are deeply in love. But Act IV shows us the king resolved on the mating of
Mālatī and Nandana; Mādhava, despairing of success through Kāmandakī’s aid alone,
decides to win the favour of the ghouls of the cemetery by an offering of fresh flesh;
this leads him in Act V to a great adventure, for on his ghastly errand he hears cries
from a temple near by, and rushes in just in time to save Mālatī whom the priest Aghoraghaṇṭa
and his acolyte Kapālakuṇḍalā were about to offer in sacrifice to the goddess Cāmuṇḍā.
He slays Aghoraghaṇṭa. In Act VI Kapālakuṇḍalā swears revenge, but for the moment
all goes well; Mālatī is to wed Nandana, but by a clever stratagem Makaranda takes
her place at the temple where she goes to worship before her marriage, and, while
Mādhava and Mālatī flee, Makaranda is led home as a bride. In Act VII we hear how
poor Nandana has been repulsed by his bride; Madayantikā comes to rebuke her sister-in-law,
finds her lover, and elopes. But they are pursued, as they make their way to rejoin
their friends, and in Act VIII we learn that the fugitives were succoured by Mādhava
and so splendidly routed their foes that the king, learning of it, gladly forgives
the runaways. But in the tumult Mālatī has been stolen away by Kapālakuṇḍalā, and
Act IX is devoted to Mādhava’s wild search with his friend to find her, which would
have been fruitless, had not Saudāminī, a pupil of Kāmandakī, by good fortune come
on Kapālakuṇḍalā and rescued her victim. A scene of lament at the beginning of Act
X is interrupted by the return of the lovers, and the king approves the marriage.
</p>
<p>The source of the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i><a class="noteRef" id="n188.1src" href="#n188.1">6</a> is very different; it is an <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>effort to describe the main story of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> by the use of dialogue narrating the main events, but a deliberate bid for dramatic
effect is made through treating the whole story as the feud of Rāvaṇa, and his plots
to ruin Rāma. The motif is introduced in Act I; at Viçvāmitra’s hermitage Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa see and love Sītā and Ūrmilā, daughters of Janaka of Videha. Rāvaṇa, however,
sends a messenger to demand Sītā’s hand in marriage, but Rāma defeats the demon Tāḍakā,
and Viçvāmitra gives him celestial weapons, and summons Çiva’s bow, which, if he bends,
he may have Sītā. The bow is broken and Rāvaṇa’s envoy departs in rage. In Act II
Rāvaṇa’s minister Mālyavant plots with his sister Çūrpaṇakhā how to make good the
defeat sustained; a letter from Paraçurāma suggests a means; they incite him to avenge
the breaking of Çiva’s bow. Paraçurāma acts on the hint in his usual haughty pride;
he arrives at Mithilā, insults Rāma and demands a conflict. In the next Act the exchange
of insults continues; Vasiṣṭha, Viçvāmitra, Çatānanda, Janaka, and Daçaratha in vain
seek to avoid a struggle between the youth and the savage Brahmin, slayer of his own
mother and exterminator of Kṣatriyas, but they fail. Act IV reveals that Paraçurāma
has been defeated, and has saluted with respect the victor; Mālyavant bethinks him
of a new device, Çūrpaṇakhā will assume the dress of Mantharā, servant of Kaikeyī,
Daçaratha’s favourite wife, and destroy the concord of the royal family. That family
is in excellent spirits; Rāma is at Mithilā with his father-in-law when the supposed
Mantharā appears, bearing an alleged letter from Kaikeyī asking him to secure Daçaratha’s
fulfilment of two boons he had once granted her; these are the selection of her son
Bharata as crown prince and Rāma’s banishment for fourteen years. Meanwhile Bharata
and his uncle Yudhājit have asked Daçaratha to crown Rāma forthwith; he is only too
willing, but Rāma arrives, reports the demands of Kaikeyī and insists on leaving for
the forest, accompanied by Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa, while Bharata is bidden remain, though
he treats himself but as vicegerent. In Act V a dialogue between the aged vultures
Jaṭāyu and Sampāti informs us of Rāma’s doings in the forest and destruction of demons;
Sampāti is uneasy and bids Jaṭāyu guard Rāma well. Jaṭāyu fares on his duty, sees
Sītā stolen by Rāvaṇa, and is slain in her defence. <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>We see Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in mourning; they wander in the forest, save, and receive
tidings from, an ascetic; Vibhīṣaṇa, brother of Rāvaṇa, exiled from Lan̄kā, wishes
to meet them at Ṛṣyamukha where also are the jewels dropped by Sītā in her despair.
Vālin, however, on the instigation of Mālyavant, seeks to forbid their entry; Rāma
persists and slays his foe, who bids his brother Sugrīva lend his aid to Rāma’s search.
In Act VI Mālyavant appears desolated by the failure of his plans; he hears of Hanumant’s
setting Lan̄kā on fire. Rāvaṇa appears, doting on Sītā; in vain Mandodarī warns him
of the advance of the enemy, but his disbelief is rudely dispelled; An̄gada bears
terms of surrender of Sītā and humiliation before Lakṣmaṇa; he refuses, and seeks
to punish the envoy, who escapes. He then goes out to battle, described at length
by Indra and Citraratha, who, as divine, can watch it from the sky; Rāvaṇa performs
feats of valour, but Hanumant revives with ambrosia Rāma and his comrades, and Rāvaṇa
finally falls dead beside his gallant son, Meghanāda. In Act VII the cities Lan̄kā
and Alakā, represented by their deities, exchange condolences; it is reported that
Sītā has by the fire ordeal proved her chastity. The whole of Rāma’s party are now
triumphant; an aerial journey carries them to the north, where they are welcomed by
Rāma’s brothers and Daçaratha’s widows, and Viçvāmitra crowns Rāma.
</p>
<p>The <i>Uttararāmacarita</i><a class="noteRef" id="n190.1src" href="#n190.1">7</a> is based on the last and late book of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>. Janaka has departed; Sītā <i>enceinte</i> is sad and Rāma is consoling her. News is brought from Vasiṣṭha; he bids the king
meet every wish of his wife, but rank first of all his duty to his people. Lakṣmaṇa
reports that the painter, who has been depicting the scenes of their wanderings, has
finished; they enter the gallery, and live over again their experiences, Rāma consoling
Sītā for her cruel separation from her husband and friends; incidentally he prays
the holy Gan̄gā to protect her and that the magic arms he has may pass spontaneously
to his sons. Sītā, wearied, falls asleep. The Brahmin Durmukha, who has been sent
to report on the feeling of the people, reveals that they doubt Sītā’s purity. Rāma
has already promised Sītā to let her visit again the forest, scene of her wanderings;
he now decides <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>that, when she has gone, she must not return, and the command is obeyed. Act II shows
an ascetic Ātreyī in converse with the spirit of the woods, Vāsantī; we learn that
Rāma is celebrating the horse sacrifice, and that Vālmīki is bringing up two fine
boys entrusted to him by a goddess. Rāma enters, sword in hand, to <span class="corr" id="xd32e7972" title="Source: lay">slay</span> an impious Çūdra Çambūka; slain, the latter, purified by this death, appears in spirit
form and leads his benefactor to Agastya’s hermitage. In Act III two rivers Tamasā
and Muralā converse; they tell us that Sītā abandoned would have killed herself but
<span class="corr" id="xd32e7976" title="Source: Gan̄ga">Gan̄gā</span> preserved her, and entrusted her two sons, born in her sorrow, to Vālmīki to train.
Then Sītā in a spirit form appears, unseen by mortals; she is permitted by Gan̄gā
to revisit under Tamasā’s care the scenes of her youth. Rāma also appears. At the
sight of the scene of their early love, both faint, but Sītā, recovering, touches
unseen Rāma who recovers only to relapse and be revived again. Finally Sītā departs,
leaving Rāma fainting.
</p>
<p>The scene changes in Act IV to the hermitage of Janaka, retired from kingly duties;
Kauçalyā, Rāma’s mother, meets him and both forget self in consoling each other. They
are interrupted by the merry noises of the children of the hermitage; one especially
is pre-eminent; questioned, he is Lava, who has a brother Kuça and who knows Rāma
only from Vālmīki’s work. The horse from Rāma’s sacrifice approaches, guarded by soldiers.
Lava joins his companions, but, unlike them, he is undaunted by the royal claim of
sovereignty and decides to oppose it. Act V passes in an exchange of martial taunts
between him and Candraketu, who guards the horse for Rāma, though each admires the
other. In Act VI a Vidyādhara and his wife, flying in the air, describe the battle
of the youthful heroes and the magic weapons they use. The arrival of Rāma interrupts
the conflict. He admires Lava’s bravery, which Candraketu extols; he questions him,
but finds that the magic weapons came to him spontaneously. Kuça enters from Bharata’s
hermitage, whither he has carried Vālmīki’s poem to be dramatized. The father admires
the two splendid youths, who are, though he knows it not, his own sons.
</p>
<p>In Act VII all take part in a supernatural spectacle devised by Bharata and played
by the Apsarases. Sītā’s fortunes after <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>her abandonment are depicted; she weeps and casts herself in the Bhāgīrathī; she reappears,
supported by Pṛthivī, the earth goddess, and Gan̄gā, each carrying a new-born infant.
Pṛthivī declaims against the harshness of Rāma, Gan̄gā excuses his acts; both ask
Sītā to care for the children until they are old enough to hand over to Vālmīki, when
she can act as she pleases. Rāma is carried away, he believes the scene real, now
he intervenes in the dialogue, now he faints. Arundhatī suddenly appears with Sītā,
who goes to her husband and brings him back to consciousness. The people acclaim the
queen, and Vālmīki presents to them Rāma’s sons, Kuça and Lava.
</p>
<p>Indian tradition asserts that of the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> Bhavabhūti wrote only up to stanza 46 of Act V, the rest being completed by Subrahmaṇya
Kavi; if this were to be taken as certain, it would be a sign that that drama was
never completed, and so was the last work of the author, but the maturity of the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> makes it clear that, whatever there may be of truth in the story, the incompleteness
cannot have been due to lack of time.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>Bhavabhūti’s Dramatic Art and Style</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is difficult to doubt that Bhavabhūti must have been induced to write his Prakaraṇa
in an effort to vie with the author of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>. It is true that no such humour as lightens that drama is found in the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e8001" title="Source: Mālatimādhava">Mālatīmādhava</span></i>, but that was doubtless due to Bhavabhūti’s own temperament; conscious that he had
no gift<a class="noteRef" id="n192.1src" href="#n192.1">8</a> in that direction, he omitted boldly the part of the Vidūṣaka which he could clearly
not have handled effectively. But in doing so he lessened greatly his resources, and
has to select for his theme in lieu of comic relief incidents of the terrible and
horrible type blended with the supernatural. The main love-story, with the episode
of the two young lovers, whose desires are thwarted by interposition of a powerful
suitor, and whose affairs are mixed up with those of two other lovers, both affections
ending in elopements, occurs in the <i>Kathāsaritsāgara</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n193.1src" href="#n193.1">9</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>and in that collection as elsewhere<a class="noteRef" id="n193.2src" href="#n193.2">10</a> we find the motifs of the sacrifice of a maiden by a magician and the offering of
flesh to the demons to obtain their aid. But the credit is due to Bhavabhūti of combining
them in an effective enough whole, and of producing in Act V a spectacle at once horrible
and exciting. He has also improved his authorities in detail; the escaped tiger replaces
the more conventional elephant; and the intrigue is more effectually welded together
by making Madayantikā the sister of Nandana, the king’s favourite. Further, he has
introduced the machinery of Kāmandakī and her assistants Avalokitā and Saudāminī.
This again is taken from the romance; Daṇḍin, as Brahmanical an author as Bhavabhūti
himself, adopts Buddhist nuns as go-betweens, and Kāmandakī’s offices are perfectly
honourable; she merely undertakes, at the request of the parents, to subtract Mālatī
from marriage with one unworthy of her and not her father’s choice. The influence
of Kālidāsa explains Act IX, which is a manifest effort to rival Act IV of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, which it excels in tragic pathos, if it is inferior to it in grace and charm. The
same Act has a flagrant imitation of the <i>Meghadūta</i> in Mādhava’s idea of sending a cloud message to his lost love, and is full of verbal
reminiscences of that text.
</p>
<p>The plot, however interesting, is extremely badly knit together; the action is dependent
to an absurd degree on accident; Mālatī twice on the verge of death is twice saved
by mere chance. Moreover, the characters live apart from all contact with real life;
they are in a city like the characters of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, but seem to exist in a world of their own in which the escape of tigers and the
abduction of maidens with murderous intent cause no surprise. There is little individuality
in hero or heroine, though the shy modesty of the latter contrasts with the boldness
of Madayantikā, who flings herself at Makaranda’s head. A friend of Mādhava, Kalahaṅsa,
is asserted later<a class="noteRef" id="n193.3src" href="#n193.3">11</a> to be a Viṭa, but has nothing characteristic, and probably the assertion is without
ground.
</p>
<p>The <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> lacks the novelty of the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>but Bhavabhūti’s effort to give some unity to the plot is commendable, though it is
unsuccessful. The fatal error, of course, is the narration of events in long speeches
in lieu of action. The conversations of Mālyavant and Çūrpaṇakhā, of Jaṭāyu and Sampāti,
of Indra and Citraratha, and of Alakā and Lan̄kā are wholly undramatic; the word-painting
of the places of their adventures, as seen from the aerial car on the return home,
has not the slightest conceivable right to a place in drama. The elaborate exchange
of passionate and grandiose defiances between Rāma and Paraçurāma which drags through
two Acts does credit to the rhetorical powers of the dramatist, but is wearisome and
a mere hindrance to the action. On the other hand, the scene where Bharata determines
to act as vicegerent and that between Vālin and Sugrīva are effective, while with
excellent taste Vālin is made an enemy, who opposes Rāma under bad advice, and the
treachery and fraternal strife of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> disappear for good. The characterization is feeble; Rāma and Sītā are tediously of
one pattern without shadow on their virtue, and neither Mālyavant nor Rāvaṇa surpasses
mediocrity.
</p>
<p>The <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> reaches no higher level as a drama; he has a period of twelve years to cover, as
he had fourteen in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i>, and to produce effective unity would be hard for any author; Bhavabhūti has made
no serious effort to this end; he has contented himself with imagining a series of
striking pictures. The first Act is admirably managed; the tragic irony of Sītā’s
gazing on the pictures of a sorrow over for good just on the verge of an even crueller
fate, and of asking for a visit to see the old scenes of her unhappiness as well as
her joy, which affords the king the means of immediately abandoning her, is perfectly
brought out. Yet excuses are made for the king; it is the voice of duty that he hears;
his counsellors who might have stayed his rash act are away. The scene in Act III,
when Sītā sees and forgives her spouse, is admirable in its delicacy of the portrayal
of her gradual but generous surrender to the proof that, though harsh, he deeply loved
her. Lava again is a fine study in his pride, followed by submission to the great
king when approached with courtesy, but the Vidyādhara’s tale of the use of the magic
weapons, doubtless an effort to vie with Bhāravi’s <i>Kirātārjunīya</i>, is ineffective. The last Act, however, reveals <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>Bhavabhūti at his best; the plain tale of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> makes Kuça and Lava recite the story of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> at a sacrifice and be recognized by their father; here a supernatural drama with
goddesses as actors leads insensibly to a happy ending, for Bhavabhūti again defies
tradition to attain the end, without which the drama would be defective even in our
eyes. Sītā and Rāma are splendidly characterized; the one in his greatness of power
and nobility of spirit, the other ethereal and spiritual, removed from the gross things
of earth. Janaka and Kauçalyā are effectively drawn; their condolences have the accent
of sincerity, but the other characters—there are twenty-four in all—present nothing
of note. It was not within Bhavabhūti’s narrow range to create figures on a generous
scale; in his other dramas they are reduced to the minimum necessary for the action.
</p>
<p>As a poem the merits of the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> are patent and undeniable. The temper of Bhavabhūti was akin to the grand and the
inspiring in nature and life; the play blends the martial fervour of Rāma and his
gallant son with the haunting pathos of the fate of the deserted queen, and the forests,
the mountains, the rivers in the first three Acts afford abundant opportunity for
his great ability in depicting the rugged as well as the tender elements of nature;
what is awe-inspiring and magnificent in its grandeur has an attraction for Bhavabhūti,
which is not shown in the more limited love of nature in Kālidāsa. He excels Kālidāsa
also in the last Act, for the reunion of Sītā and Rāma has a depth of sentiment, not
evoked by the tamer picture of the meeting of Duḥṣanta and Çakuntalā; both Rāma and
Sītā are creatures of more vital life and deeper experience than the king and his
woodland love.
</p>
<p>We find, in fact, in Bhavabhūti, in a degree unknown to Kālidāsa, child of fortune,
to whom life appeared as an ordered joyous whole, the sense of the mystery of things;
‘what brings things together’, he says, ‘is some mysterious inward tie; it is certainly
not upon outward circumstances that affection rests’.<a class="noteRef" id="n195.1src" href="#n195.1">12</a> Self-sacrifice is a reality to Bhavabhūti; Rāma is prepared to abandon without a
pang affection, compassion, and felicity, nay Sītā herself, for the sake of his people,<a class="noteRef" id="n195.2src" href="#n195.2">13</a> and he acts up to his resolve. Friendship is to him sacred; to guard a friend’s interests
<span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>at the cost of one’s own, to avoid in dealings with him all malice and guile, and
to strive for his weal as if for one’s own is the essential mark of true friendship.<a class="noteRef" id="n196.1src" href="#n196.1">14</a> Admirable also is his conception of love, far nobler than that normal in Indian literature;
it is the same in happiness and sorrow, adapted to every circumstance of life, in
which the heart finds solace, unspoiled by age, mellowing and becoming more valuable
as in course of time reserve dies away, a supreme blessing attained only by those
that are fortunate and after long toil.<a class="noteRef" id="n196.2src" href="#n196.2">15</a> The child completes the union; it ties in a common knot of union the strands of its
parents’ hearts.<a class="noteRef" id="n196.3src" href="#n196.3">16</a> Bhavabhūti was clearly a solitary soul; this is attested by the prologue of the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>ye nāma kecid iha naḥ prathayanty avajñām: jānanti te kim api tān prati naiṣa yatnaḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>utpatsyate ’sti mama ko ’pi samānadharmā: kālo hy ayam anavadhir vipulā ca pṛthvī.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Those that disparage me know little; for them my effort is not made; there will or
does exist some one with like nature to mine, for time is boundless and the earth
is wide.’ Yet we may sympathize with those who felt<a class="noteRef" id="n196.4src" href="#n196.4">17</a> that his art was unfit for the stage, for Bhavabhūti’s style has many demerits in
addition to the defects of his technique.
</p>
<p>Bhavabhūti in fact proclaims here as his own merit richness and elevation of expression
(<i>prauḍhatvam udāratā ca vacasām</i>) and depth of meaning, and we must admit that he has no small grounds for his claims.
The depth of thought and grandeur which can be admitted in the case of Bhavabhūti
must be measured by Indian standards, and be understood subject to the grave limitations
which are imposed on any Brahmanical speculation as to existence by the orthodoxy
which is as apparent in Bhavabhūti as it is in the lighter-hearted Kālidāsa. When,
therefore, we are told<a class="noteRef" id="n196.5src" href="#n196.5">18</a> that ‘with reference to Kālidāsa he holds a position such as Aeschylus holds with
reference to Euripides’, we must not take too seriously the comparison. No poet, in
fact, suggests less readily comparison with Euripides than does Kālidāsa. He has nothing
whatever of the questioning mind of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>Greek dramatist, contemporary of the Sophists, and eager inquirer into the validity
of all established conventions. In style again he aims at a level of perfection of
achievement, which was neither sought nor attained by Euripides. Unquestionably, if
any parallel were worth making, Kālidāsa would fall to be ranked as the Sophokles
of the Indian drama, for as far as any Indian poet could, ‘he saw life steadily and
saw it whole’, and was free from the vain questionings which vexed the soul of Euripides.
Bhavabhūti again cannot seriously be compared with Aischylos, for he accepted without
question the Brahmanical conceptions of world order, unlike the great Athenian who
sought to interpret for himself the fundamental facts of existence, and who found
for them no solution in popular belief or traditional religion. There can, moreover,
be no greater contrast in style than that between the simple strength of Aischylos,
despite his power of brilliant imagery,<a class="noteRef" id="n197.1src" href="#n197.1">19</a> and the over-elaboration and exaggeration of Bhavabhūti. The distinction between
Kālidāsa and his successor is of a different kind. Both accepted the traditional order,
but Kālidāsa, enjoying, we may feel assured, a full measure of prosperity in the golden
age of India under the Gupta empire, viewed with a determined optimism all that passed
before him in life, in strange contrast to the bitterness of the denunciations of
existence which Buddhism, then losing ground, has set forth as its contribution to
the problems of life. Bhavabhūti, on his part, recognized with a truer insight, sharpened
perhaps by the obvious inferiority of his fortunes and failure to enjoy substantial
royal favour, the difficulties and sorrows of life; his theme is not the joys of a
pleasure-loving great king or the vicissitudes of a Purūravas, too distant from humanity
to touch our own life, but the bitter woes of Rāma and Sītā, who have for us the reality
of manhood and womanhood, as many a touch reminds us:<a class="noteRef" id="n197.2src" href="#n197.2">20</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>kim api kim api mandam mandam asattiyogād: avicalitakapolaṁ jalpatoç ca krameṇa</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>açithilaparirambhavyāpṛtaikaikadoṣṇor: aviditagatayāmā rātrir evaṁ vyaraṅsīt.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘As slowly and gently, cheek pressed against cheek, we whispered soft nothings, each
clasping the other with warm embrace, the night, whose watches had sped unnoticed,
came to an end.’
<span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>As regards the formal side of Bhavabhūti’s style we must unquestionably admit his
power of expression, which is displayed equally in all three dramas. To modern taste
Bhavabhūti is most attractive when he is simple and natural, as he can be when it
pleases him. Thus in Act VI of the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> we have a pretty expression of Mādhava’s joy at the words of love of him uttered
by Mālatī when she has no idea of his presence near her:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>mlānasya jīvakusumasya vikāsanāni: saṁtarpaṇāni sakalendriyamohanāni</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>ānandanāni hṛdayaikarasāyanāni: diṣṭyā mayāpy adhigatāni vacomṛtāni.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Fortune has favoured me, for I have heard the nectar of her words that make to bloom
again the faded flower of my life, delightful, disturbing every sense, causing gladness,
sole elixir for my heart.’ The deliberate rhyming effect is as appropriate as it is
uncommon in such elaboration, and it is characteristic that the same effect is shortly
afterwards repeated. Effective simplicity and directness also characterize the speech,
in Sanskrit contrary to the usual rule, of Buddharakṣitā in Act VII, when she clinches
the argument in favour of the elopement of Madayantikā and Makaranda:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>preyān manorathasahasravṛtaḥ sa eṣaḥ: suptapramattajanam etad amātyaveçma</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>prauḍhaṁ tamaḥ kuru kṛtajñatayaiva bhadram: utkṣiptamūkamaṇinūpuram ehi yāmaḥ.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Here is thy beloved, on whom a thousand times thy hopes have rested; in the minister’s
palace the men are asleep or drunken; impenetrable is the darkness; be grateful and
show thy favour; come, let us silence our jewelled anklets by laying them aside, and
depart hence.’ Equally effective is the expression of the admirable advice tendered
to Mādhava and Mālatī at the moment when Kāmandakī has succeeded in securing their
union:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>preyo mitram bandhutā vā samagrā: sarve kāmāḥ çevadhir jīvitaṁ vā</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>strīṇām bhartā dharmadārāç ca puṅsām: ity anyonyaṁ vatsayor jñātam astu.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Know, my dear children, that to a wife her husband and to a husband his lawful wife
are, each to each, the dearest of friends, the sum total of relationships, the completeness
of desire, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>perfection of treasures, even life itself.’ Pretty again are the terms in which Kāmandakī
laments Mālatī in Act X when she learns of her disappearance:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>ā janmanaḥ pratimuhūrtaviçeṣaramyāṇy: āceṣṭitāni tava samprati tāni tāni</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>cāṭūni cārumadhurāṇi ca saṁsmṛtāni: dehaṁ dahanti hṛdayaṁ ca vidārayanti.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘My body is aflame and my heart torn in sunder by the memory of thy childish movements
which grew more delightful every hour from thy birth, and of the beauty and sweetness
of thy loving words.’
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, the more to be regretted that Bhavabhūti was not content with simplicity,
but is often too fond of elaborate and overloaded descriptions, which are fatally
lacking in simplicity and intelligibility and can be fully comprehended only after
careful study and examination. We must, however, it is clear, admit that Bhavabhūti
definitely improved in taste as the years went on. The latest of his dramas, the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i>, is far less obnoxious to criticism for defects of judgement than the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>, which may be set down as an adventure in a genre unsuited to the poet’s talent.
There is an admirable touch in the scene in Act I of the play where Sītā, wearied,
falls to rest on the pillow of Rāma’s arm, that arm which no other woman can claim
and which has ever lulled her to sleep, and he gazes on her in fond admiration:<a class="noteRef" id="n199.1src" href="#n199.1">21</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>iyaṁ gehe lakṣmīr iyam amṛtavartir nayanayor</i> </p>

<p class="line"><i>ayaṁ kaṇṭhe bāhuḥ çiçiramasṛṇo mauktikasaraḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>kim asyā na preyo yadi param asahyas tu virahaḥ.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘She is Fortune herself in my home; she is a pencil of ambrosia for the eyes; her
touch here on my body is as fragrant as sandal juice; her arm round my neck is cool
and soft as a necklace of pearls; what in her is there that is not dear, save only
the misery of separation from her?’ Scarcely are the words said than the attendant
enters with the word, ‘It has come’, which on her lips is to announce the advent of
the spy whose report is to lead to Sītā’s banishment, while the audience, following
the words, applies it at once to the separation which Rāma was deploring, <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>and which to him was the parting in the past when Rāvaṇa stole his bride.
</p>
<p>The spontaneous regard which springs up for each other in the hearts of the two princes
Lava and Candraketu when they meet is admirably depicted:<a class="noteRef" id="n200.1src" href="#n200.1">22</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>yadṛcchāsampātaḥ kim u guṇagaṇānām atiçayaḥ</i> </p>

<p class="first">‘Is it this chance encounter, or his wealth of splendid qualities, or an ancient love,
firm bound in a former birth, or a common tie of blood unknown through the might of

</p>
<p>The rebuke which Vāsantī addresses to Rāma for his treatment of Sītā, despite the
loyalty of the queen, is effectively broken off by a faint:<a class="noteRef" id="n200.2src" href="#n200.2">23</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>tvaṁ jīvitaṁ tvam asi me hṛdayaṁ dvitīyam</i> </p>

<p class="line"><i>tām eva çāntam athavā kim ataḥ pareṇa.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘ “Thou art my life, my second heart, thou the moonlight of my eyes, the ambrosia
for my body thou”: with these and a hundred other endearments didst thou win her simple

</p>
<p>Elsewhere we have less simplicity, but in these cases we must distinguish carefully
between those instances in which the difficulty and complexity of expression serve
to illustrate the thought, and those in which the words are made to stand in lieu
of ideas. In many cases Bhavabhūti may justly claim to have achieved substantial success,
even when he is not precisely simple. The effect of love on Mādhava is effectively
expressed:<a class="noteRef" id="n200.3src" href="#n200.3">24</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>paricchedātītaḥ sakalavacanānām aviṣayaḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>punarjanmany asminn anubhavapathaṁ yo na gatavān</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>vivekapradhvaṅsād upacitamahāmohagahano</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>vikāraḥ ko ’py antar jaḍayati ca tāpaṁ ca kurute.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘An emotion, evading determination, inexpressible by words, never before experienced
in this birth of mine, wholly confusing <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>because of the impossibility of examination, is at once numbing me within and filling
me with a torment of fire.’
</p>
<p>The poet’s command of the philosophical conceptions of his day is shown in the verse
following:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>paricchedavyaktir bhavati na puraḥsthe ’pi viṣaye</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>bhavaty abhyaste ’pi smaraṇam atathābhāvavirasam</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>na saṁtāpacchedo himasarasi vā candramasi vā</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>mano niṣṭhāçūnyam bhramati ca kim apy ālikhati ca.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Though an object be before one’s gaze, determination is not easy; brought back, memory
intervenes to introduce an element of falsity; neither in the cool lake nor in the
moonbeams can passion be quenched; my mind, powerless to attain a fixed result, wanders,
and yet records something.’
</p>
<p>We have a further effective picture of the physical effect of love on Mādhava when
he seeks to assuage his sorrows by depicting his beloved from memory:<a class="noteRef" id="n201.1src" href="#n201.1">25</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>vāraṁ vāraṁ tirayati dṛçor udgamam bāṣpapūras</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>tatsaṁkalpopahitajaḍima stambham abhyeti gātram</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>sadyaḥ svidyann ayam aviratotkampalolān̄gulīkaḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>pāṇir lekhāvidhiṣu nitarāṁ vartate kiṁ karomi.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Time after time the tears that stream from my eyes blind my sight; my body is paralysed
by the numbness born of the thought of her; when I seek to draw, my hand grows moist
and trembles incessantly; ah, what is there that I can do?’
</p>
<p>It is, however, easy to pass into exaggeration, as in:<a class="noteRef" id="n201.2src" href="#n201.2">26</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>līneva pratibimbiteva likhitevotkīrṇarūpeva ca</i> </p>

<p class="line"><i>cintāsaṁtatitantujālanibiḍasyūteva ca lagnā priyā.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘So have I grasped my dear one that she is as it were merged in me, reflected in me,
depicted in me, her form mingled in me, cast into me, cemented with adamant to me,
planted within me, pinned to my soul by the five arrows of love, firmly sewn into
the fabric of my thought <i>continuum</i>.’
</p>
<p>A stanza like this, whatever credit it may do to the ingenuity of its author, hardly
gives any high opinion of his literary taste, but we are undoubtedly forced to assume
that he believed deliberately in the merits of the style he adopted, which as <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>contrasted with that of Kālidāsa belongs to the Gauḍī type,<a class="noteRef" id="n202.1src" href="#n202.1">27</a> which loves compounds in prose, and aims at the grandiose rather than sweetness and
grace. The adoption of such a style, possibly under the influence of the reputation
of Bāṇa, is wholly unjustified in drama; the prose, which normally in the plays moves
freely and easily, is hampered by compounds of ridiculous length which must have been
nearly as unintelligible to his audiences as they are now without careful study. The
defect, it is true, gradually diminishes; the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> is far freer from sins of this type. In the verse the theory does not make such demands
for compounds, so that the poetry is often better than the prose; especially in his
latest drama it gains clearness and intelligibility. Sanskrit, however, was clearly
in large measure an artificial language to Bhavabhūti; he employs far too freely rare
terms culled from the lexicons, honourable to his scholarship but not to his taste,
and the same lack of taste is displayed in the excess of his exaggerations. Of the
sweetness and charm of Kālidāsa he has as little as of the power of suggestion displayed
by his predecessor; but he excels in drawing with a few strokes the typical features
of a situation or emotion. He seeks propriety in his characters’ utterances; Janaka
shows his philosophical training, as do the two ascetics in Act IV; Lava manifests
his religious pupilship under Vālmīki; Tamasā as a river goddess uses similes from
the waters. Effective is the speech of the old chamberlain who addresses the newly-crowned
Rāma as ‘Rāma dear’ to remember the change and fall back on ‘Your Majesty’. It may
be admitted also that in many passages Bhavabhūti does produce effective concatenations
of sounds, but only at the expense of natural expression and clearness of diction.
The appreciation which he has excited in India is often due not to his real merits,
but to admiration of these linguistic <i>tours de force</i>, such as the following:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>dordaṇḍāñcitacandraçekharadhanurdaṇḍāvabhan̄godyataṣ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>ṭan̄kāradhvanir āryabālacaritaprastāvanāḍiṇḍimaḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>drākparyastakapālasampuṭamiladbrahmāṇḍabhāṇḍodara—</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>bhrāmyatpiṇḍitacaṇḍimā katham aho nādyāpi viçrāmyati.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘The twang, emanating from the broken staff of Çiva’s bow, bent by his staff-like
arms, is the trumpet sound proclaiming to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>world the youthful prowess of my noble brother; it ceases not yet, its reverberations
enhanced by its rumbling through the interstices of the fragments of the universe
rent asunder by the dread explosion.’ It may readily be admitted that the sound effect
of such a verse is admirable, but it is attained only at the sacrifice of clearness
and propriety of diction.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bhavabhūti, with his limited scope, confines himself to Çaurasenī, and models his
style on Sanskrit, so that the speakers of Prākrit are committed to the absurdity
of elaborate style in what is supposed to be a vernacular. For him doubtless as for
later poets the production of Prākrit was a mechanical task of transforming Sanskrit
according to the rules of Vararuci or other grammarians.
</p>
<p>In metre the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> shows a free use of the Çloka, as is inevitable in an epic play; it is found 129
times; the Çārdūlavikrīḍita (75), Vasantatilaka (39), Çikhariṇī (31), and Sragdharā
(28) are the other chief metres; the Upajāti, Mandākrāntā, and Mālinī are not rare,
but the Āryā (3) and Gīti (1) are almost gone, and there are only sporadic Aupacchandasika,
Puṣpitāgrā, Pṛthvī, Praharṣiṇī, Rathoddhatā, Vaṅçasthā, Çālinī, and Hariṇī. The <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> has the same metres, save the Sragdharā, a curious omission; it adds the Drutavilambita
and Mañjubhāṣiṇī; the occurrences of the Çloka are 89, the Çikhariṇī is second (30),
Vasantatilaka third (26), and Çārdūlavikrīḍita fourth (25). The <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> has the same metres as the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> plus the Narkuṭaka<a class="noteRef" id="n203.1src" href="#n203.1">28</a> and a Daṇḍaka of six short syllables and sixteen amphimacers; here the Vasantatilaka
takes first place (49), Çārdūlavikrīḍita (32), Çikhariṇī (21), and Hariṇī (12). The
Mālinī (21) and Mandākrāntā (15) take on greater importance, while the Çloka is negligible
(14). The fact that there are only 8 Āryās reflects the changed character of Bhavabhūti’s
versification from that of Kālidāsa.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A curious vagueness besets our knowledge of Viçākhadatta or Viçākhadeva, son of the
Mahārāja Bhāskaradatta or the minister Pṛthu, grandson of the feudatory Vaṭeçvaradatta.
None of these persons are elsewhere known, and for his date we are reduced to conjectures.
The play ends with a stanza mentioning Candragupta as would be natural in a play of
which he is hero, but there are variants in the manuscripts, including Dantivarman,
Rantivarman, and (A)vantivarman. The last has been utilized to fix the date, but in
two different ways; Avantivarman might be the Maukhari king whose son married Harṣa’s
daughter, or the king of Kashmir (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 855–83); Jacobi<a class="noteRef" id="n204.1src" href="#n204.1">1</a> identifies the eclipse referred to in the play as that of December 2, 860, when,
he holds, Çūra, the king’s minister, had the play performed. There is no conclusive
argument for or against this clever combination. Konow<a class="noteRef" id="n204.2src" href="#n204.2">2</a> sees in Candragupta the ruler of the Gupta line, and would make the poet a younger
contemporary of Kālidāsa, but this is fantasy. We have some evidence of imitation
of Ratnākara by Viçākhadatta, but it is possibly not conclusive as to date. Still
less weight attaches to the fact that in one manuscript the Nāndī is supposed to be
over before the play begins, for that is merely a habit of South Indian manuscripts,
true to the Bhāsa tradition. There is nothing that prevents a date in the ninth century,
though the work may be earlier.<a class="noteRef" id="n204.3src" href="#n204.3">3</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Whatever its date, the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n205.1src" href="#n205.1">4</a> is one of the great Sanskrit dramas, although in India itself its merits have long
been underrated, because it does not conform to the normal model. It is a drama of
political intrigue, centred in the person of Rākṣasa, formerly minister of the Nandas,
who is now sworn to revenge their destruction on Cāṇakya, the Brahmin who vowed to
ruin them, and who, in pursuance of this end, secured an alliance between Candragupta,
their rival, and Parvateça<a class="noteRef" id="n205.2src" href="#n205.2">5</a> and attacked Pāṭaliputra. Rākṣasa seeing resistance vain surrendered the city; the
last of the royal house, Sarvārthasiddhi, retired to an ascetic life, and Rākṣasa
left to weave plots elsewhere. His effort by a poison maiden to slay Candragupta miscarried;
instead, Parvateça fell a victim through Cāṇakya’s cunning. This so far aided Rākṣasa
that his son Malayaketu left Candragupta and is now his ally, preparing with the aid
of a host of motley origin, including princes of Kulūta, Malaya, Kashmir, Scind, and
Persia to attack the capital. Act I shows Cāṇakya’s schemes; in a monologue he expresses
his detestation of the Nandas and his determination to secure Rākṣasa as minister
for his lord, for he is convinced of Rākṣasa’s worth and has no desire himself to
rule. Nipuṇaka, his spy, enters; he has found a Jain Jīvasiddhi hostile to the king—he
is in reality Cāṇakya’s agent; the scribe Çakaṭadāsa is a real enemy, as is the jeweller
Candanadāsa, in whose house are Rākṣasa’s wife and child; by good fortune he has secured
the signet ring of Rākṣasa, dropped by the former in pulling indoors the child. Cāṇakya
sees his chance; he writes a letter, has it copied in good faith by Çakaṭadāsa and
sealed with Rākṣasa’s seal; Çakaṭadāsa is then arrested, but on the point of impalement
is rescued by Siddhārthaka, another spy of the minister’s, who flees to Rākṣasa; Jīvasiddhi
is banished in ignominy to the same destination, and Candanadāsa is flung into prison,
to await death for having harboured Rākṣasa’s family, which has escaped. Finally,
it is reported that Bhāgurāyaṇa and others of the court are also fled, <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>news received by Cāṇakya with admirable composure, for they are also his emissaries.
</p>
<p>Act II shows Rākṣasa’s counter-plots. Virādhaka, in a serpent-charmer’s disguise,
bears him news of ill import: the scheme to murder Candragupta, as he passed under
a coronation arch, has failed, Vairodhaka, uncle of Malayaketu, who stayed when his
nephew fled and had been crowned also as lord of half the realm, being slain in lieu
of Candragupta; Abhayadatta, who offered him poison, has been forced to drink the
draught; Pramodaka, the chamberlain, has flaunted the wealth sent to him to use in
bribes, and is dead in misery; the bold spirits, who were to issue from a subterranean
passage into the king’s bedchamber, have been detected by the king through the sight
of ants bearing a recent meal, and burnt in agony in their hiding place; Jīvasiddhi
is banished, Çakaṭadāsa condemned to the stake, Candanadāsa to the same fate. The
tale of woe is interrupted by the advent of Çakaṭadāsa with Siddhārthaka, who restores
his seal to Rākṣasa, saying he had picked it up at Candanadāsa’s house, and begs permission
to remain in his train. Virādhaka now gives the one piece of good news: Candragupta
is tired of Cāṇakya. At this moment Rākṣasa is asked if he will buy some precious
jewels, and hastily bids Çakaṭadāsa see to the price, little knowing that they are
sent by Cāṇakya to entrap him. Act III displays Cāṇakya at his ablest; a fine scene
takes place between him and Candragupta, on the score that he has forbidden all feasting
without telling the king; the monarch finally upbraids him, the minister taunts him
with ingratitude and insolence, resigns office, and leaves in high dudgeon; none but
the chief actors know the whole is but a ruse, and Rākṣasa’s fortunes seem again fair.
In Act IV the bright prospect begins to darken; Bhāgurāyaṇa, for the officials who
have deserted to Malayaketu, explains to that monarch that they desire to deal direct
with him, not Rākṣasa; the latter, they suggest, is no real foe of Candragupta; if
Cāṇakya were out of the way, there would be nothing to hinder his allying himself
with Candragupta. The king is perplexed, and his doubt increases when he overhears
a conversation between Rākṣasa and a courier who bears the glad tidings of the split
between the king and Cāṇakya; Rākṣasa eagerly exclaims that Candragupta is now in
the palms of his hands <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>(<i>hastatalagata</i>), a phrase which unhappily lends itself to the suspicious interpretation that he
meditates alliance with that king. Malayaketu’s conversation with Rākṣasa, which ensues,
leaves him half-hearted for an advance, for he cannot rid himself of his suspicions
of the minister. The Act ends with Jīvasiddhi’s admission to see Rākṣasa, who asks
him in vain for intelligible advice as to the time for an advance, receiving in lieu
much astrological lore and what is really a presage of disaster. This is achieved
in Act V. First Jīvasiddhi approaches Bhāgurāyaṇa, who is entrusted with the grant
of permits to leave the camp, and admits—with feigned reluctance—in order to get a
permit, that he fears Rākṣasa, who used him formerly when he was arranging for the
poisoning of Parvateça, but now seeks to slay him. The king, who overhears this, is
wild with rage; he had deemed his father slain by Cāṇakya, and Bhāgurāyaṇa has great
difficulty in persuading him that Rākṣasa’s action might be deemed justifiable, and
that at any rate vengeance must wait. Siddhārthaka, however, now appears a prisoner,
caught trying to escape without a passport; beaten, he finally gives evidence against
Rākṣasa in the shape of the letter written in Act I by Çakaṭadāsa, which he asserts
he was to bear from Rākṣasa to Candragupta, a jewel sealed, like the letter, with
Rākṣasa’s seal—one given by Malayaketu to Rākṣasa and by him to Siddhārthaka for rescuing
Çakaṭadāsa, and a verbal message, stating the terms demanded by the allied kings for
their treachery, and Rākṣasa’s own demand, the removal of Cāṇakya. The king confronts
Rākṣasa with the proofs, and the minister has made his case worse from the start,
for, asked the order of march proposed, he assigns to the allied kings the proud duty
of guarding the king’s person, which Malayaketu interprets as a device to facilitate
their treachery. Rākṣasa is bewildered; he can deny the message, but the seal and
the writing are genuine; can Çakaṭadāsa have turned traitor through fear? The argument
against him is clinched by the king’s seeing that he wears a fine jewel, one of those
purchased at the close of Act II; it was the king’s father’s, and must, he insists,
be the price of the minister’s treachery. Incensed, the foolish king gives orders
to bury alive those allied kings who craved territory as their reward, and to trample
under elephants those who sought them as their share. <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>All is confusion, and Rākṣasa, insolently spared, slips away to fulfil his duty of
rescuing his friend Candanadāsa.
</p>
<p>Act VI reveals Rākṣasa in the capital deeply soliloquizing on the failure of all his
ends, and the fate of his friend. A spy of Candragupta’s approaches him, and passes
himself off as one seeking death, in despair for Candanadāsa’s fate, on which Candragupta’s
mind is relentlessly set. He warns Rākṣasa that he may not attempt a rescue, for,
when they fear one, the executioners slay the victim out of hand, and Rākṣasa sees
that nothing save self-sacrifice is left for him. The net is now firmly cast; Act
VII sees Candanadāsa led out to death, his wife and child beside him, a scene manifestly
imitated from the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>; the wife is determined to die also, but Rākṣasa intervenes; Cāṇakya and Candragupta
come on the scene, and Rākṣasa decides to accept the office of minister pressed on
him by both, when thus alone he can save, not his own life, but that of Candanadāsa
and his friends. They, indeed, are in sore case, for Malayaketu’s massacre of the
kings has broken the host into fragments, and the apparent rebels have taken the moment
to capture him and his court. As minister, Rākṣasa is permitted to free Malayaketu
and restore his lands, Candanadāsa is rewarded, and a general amnesty approved.
</p>
<p>The interest in the action never flags; the characters of Cāṇakya and Rākṣasa are
excellent foils. Each in his own way is admirable; Cāṇakya in his undying and just
hatred of the Nandas, and Rākṣasa in his unsparing devotion to their cause, his noble
desire to save Candanadāsa, and his fine submission, for the sake of others, to a
yoke he had purposed never to bear. The maxims of politics in which both delight may
amuse us; they are essentially the Indian views of polity and give the play a contact
with reality which Professor Lévi<a class="noteRef" id="n208.1src" href="#n208.1">6</a> wrongly denies; the plots and counterplots of both ministers are the type in which
Indian polity has ever delighted. The minor figures are all interesting; Siddhārthaka
and Samiddhārthaka, gentlemen who even disguise themselves as Caṇḍālas in the last
Act, so that they may serve Cāṇakya’s aims; Nipuṇaka, whose cleverness in finding
the seal justifies the name he bears; the disguised Virādhaka, the honest Çakaṭadāsa,
the noble Candanadāsa and <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>his wife, the one female figure in the play. The kings Candragupta and Malayaketu
represent the contrast of ripe intelligence with youthful ardour, and the weak petulance
of one who does not know men’s worth, and who rashly and cruelly slays his allies
on the faith of treachery. Bhāgurāyaṇa, who is the false friend deluding Malayaketu
in Candragupta’s interest, is a carefully drawn figure; he dislikes the work, but
dismisses his repulsion as essentially the result of dependence which forbids a man
to judge between right and wrong.
</p>
<p>Viçākhadatta’s diction is admirably forcible and direct; the martial character of
his dramas reflects itself in the clearness and rapidity of his style, which eschews
the deplorable compounds which disfigure Bhavabhūti’s works. An artist in essentials,
he uses images, metaphors, and similes with tasteful moderation; alone of the later
dramatists, he realizes that he is writing a drama, not composing sets<a class="noteRef" id="n209.1src" href="#n209.1">7</a> of elegant extracts. Hence is explained the paucity of citations from him in the
anthologies, which naturally find little to their purpose in an author of a more manly
strain than is usual in the drama. It is significant that the <i>Subhāṣitāvali</i> cites but two stanzas, under his name, as Viçākhadeva, both pretty but undistinguished;
the second<a class="noteRef" id="n209.2src" href="#n209.2">8</a> is graceful:

<p class="first">‘The mountains, with their leaping waterfalls, girt with rainbow clouds, shone like
rutting elephants clad in raiment of bright hue.’
</p>
<p>More characteristic is the terse and effective phraseology in which he describes the
dilemma of Malayaketu when his mind has been poisoned against Rākṣasa:<a class="noteRef" id="n209.3src" href="#n209.3">9</a>
</p>

</p>
<p>Rākṣasa’s name inevitably demands the usual play on its sense of demoniac, but Malayaketu’s
feeling redeems the use from triviality:<a class="noteRef" id="n210.2src" href="#n210.2">11</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>The Language and the Metres of the Mudrārākṣasa</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sanskrit of the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i> is classical, and the Prākrits number three, for, in addition to the normal Çaurasenī
and Māhārāṣṭrī, Māgadhī is used by the Jain monk, by Siddhārthaka and Samiddhārthaka
as Caṇḍālas, by a servant and an envoy. We may take it that Viçākhadatta wrote from
the grammars, and this is confirmed by the fact that we find in some <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>of the manuscripts traces of the carrying through of characteristic Māgadhī features,
<i>ññ</i> for <i>ṇṇ</i> for Sanskrit <i>ny</i>; <i>ẖk</i> for <i>kṣ</i>; <i>çc</i> for <i>cch</i>, <i>st</i> for <i>sth</i>, <i>sṭ</i> for <i>ṣṭ</i> and for <i>ṣṭh</i>, and the usual <i>ç</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>e</i>. It is possible, of course, that these are no more than restorations by scribes,
but they may easily be more venerable. It is also interesting to note that there appear
traces of Çaurasenī verses, which is perfectly possible, as the theory does not necessitate
all persons who use Çaurasenī in prose singing in Māhārāṣṭrī; that is given as requisite
for women only, and in this play they are men who use these Çaurasenī verses.
</p>
<p>The metres most used are Çārdūlavikrīḍita (39), Sragdharā (24), Vasantatilaka (19),
and Çikhariṇī (18); the Çloka occurs also 22 times. Other metres are sporadic, save
Prākrit Āryās; they include Upajāti, Aupacchandasika, Puṣpitāgrā, Praharṣiṇī, Mālinī,
Mandākrāntā, Rucirā, Vaṅçasthā, Suvadanā (iv. 16), and Hariṇī.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The age of Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa, Mṛgarājalakṣman is unknown. But he is cited by Vāmana
(iv. 3. 28) and Ānandavardhana<a class="noteRef" id="n212.1src" href="#n212.1">18</a> and so is before <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 800. Tradition, preserved in the Tagore family, makes him out to be a Brahmin summoned
from Kanyakubja to Bengal by Ādisūra, the founder of a dynasty of eleven kings, who

of the eighth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> It has been suggested<a class="noteRef" id="n212.2src" href="#n212.2">19</a> that it was identical with the Guptas of Magadha since Ādityasena, son of Mādhavagupta

who was alive in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 671. The date, however, is clearly conjectural for the present.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa has chosen as his topic<a class="noteRef" id="n212.3src" href="#n212.3">20</a> one episode from the great epic and has endeavoured to make it capable of dramatic
representation. One of the worst of the insults heaped on Draupadī in the gambling
scene of the epic is the dragging of her by the hair before the assembly by Duḥçāsana,
one of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>Kauravas. Draupadī vows never to braid her hair again until the insult is avenged,
as it ultimately is.
</p>
<p>Act I shows Bhīma in conversation with Sahadeva as they await the result of Kṛṣna’s
visit as an envoy to seek to settle the <span class="corr" id="xd32e8685" title="Source: fued">feud</span> between <span class="corr" id="xd32e8688" title="Source: Pāṇdavas">Pāṇḍavas</span> and Kauravas; Bhīma shows his insolent confidence in his power and his bitter anger,
by declaring that he will break with Yudhiṣṭhira if he makes peace before the insult
to Draupadī has been avenged. Sahadeva in vain seeks to appease him, and Draupadī
adds to his bitterness by relating a fresh insult in a careless allusion by Duryodhana’s
queen. Kṛṣṇa returns, nothing effected; indeed he has had to use his magic arms to
escape detention in the enemies’ camp. War is inevitable, but Draupadī, more human
now, bids her husbands take care of their lives against the enemy. Act II opens with
an ominous dream of Bhānumatī, Duryodhana’s queen; an ichneumon (<i>nakula</i>) has slain a hundred serpents; it is a presage that the Pāṇḍavas—of whom Nakula is
one—will slay the hundred Kauravas. The king, overhearing but not understanding, thinks
he is betrayed; learning the truth, at first he inclines to fear, but shakes off the
temporary depression. The queen offers oblation to the sun to remove the evil omen;
the king appears to comfort her: a storm arises, and they seek security in a pavilion,
where they indulge in passages of love. Then appears the mother of Jayadratha of Sindhu,
slayer of Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, who fears the revenge of the Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana
makes light of her fears; he despises the resentment of the Pāṇḍavas, gloating over
the remembrance of the insults heaped on Draupadī. Finally he mounts his chariot for
the battle. Act III presents an episode of horror but also of power; a Rākṣasī and
her husband feed on the blood and flesh of the dead on the battlefield; they have
been summoned thither, for Ghaṭotkaca, son of Hiḍimbā by Bhīma, is dead, and his demon
mother has bidden them attend Bhīma in his revenge on the Kuru host. They see the
first-fruits in Droṇa’s death at the hands of Dhṛṣṭadyumna, when he lets fall his
arms, deceived by the lie of his son’s death. They retire before Açvatthāman who advances,
but is filled with grief when he learns of the treacherous device which cost his father’s
life. His uncle Kṛpa consoles him, and bids him ask Duryodhana for the command in
the battle. But in the meantime Karṇa has poisoned Duryodhana’s mind; Droṇa had fought,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>only to win the imperial authority for his son, and has sacrificed his life in disappointment
at the failure of his plans. Kṛpa and Açvatthāman come up; Duryodhana condoles, Karṇa
sneers, Açvatthāman asks for the command, but is refused it, as Karṇa has been promised
it. Açvatthāman quarrels with Karṇa, and a duel is barely prevented; Açvatthāman accuses
Duryodhana of partiality, and will fight no more. Their disputes are interrupted by
Bhīma’s boast that he will now slay Duḥçāsana; Karṇa at Açvatthāman’s instigation
makes ready to rescue him, Duryodhana follows suit, Açvatthāman would go also, but
is stayed by a voice from heaven and can only bid Kṛpa lend his aid.
</p>
<p>In Act IV Duryodhana is brought in wounded; recovering, he learns of Duḥçāsana’s death
and a Kuru disaster; a messenger from Karṇa tells in a long Prākrit speech of the
death of Karṇa’s son, and gives an appeal for aid written in Karṇa’s blood. Duryodhana
makes ready for battle, but is interrupted by the arrival of his parents, Dhṛtarāṣṭra
and Gāndhārī with Sañjaya, whose advent begins Act V. The aged couple and Sañjaya
urge in vain Duryodhana to peace; he refuses, and again, hearing of Karṇa’s death,
unaided, is ready to part for the field, when Arjuna and Bhīma appear; Bhīma insists
on their saluting with insults their uncle; Duryodhana reproves them, but Arjuna insists
that it is just retribution for the acquiescence of the aged king in Draupadī’s ill-treatment.
Duryodhana defies Bhīma, who would fight, but Arjuna forbids, and Yudhiṣṭhira’s summons
takes them away. Açvatthāman arrives, and seeks reconciliation with Duryodhana, who
receives him coldly; he withdraws, followed by Sañjaya, bidden by Dhṛtarāṣṭra to appease
him.
</p>
<p>Act VI tells us from an announcement to Yudhiṣṭhira and Draupadī of Duryodhana’s death
at Bhīma’s hands. But a Cārvāka comes in, who tells a very different story; Bhīma
and Arjuna are dead. Yudhiṣṭhira and Draupadī resolve on death, and the Cārvāka, who
is really a Rākṣasa, departs in glee. When, however, they are about to die, a noise
is heard; Yudhiṣṭhira, deeming it Duryodhana, rushes to arms, while Draupadī runs
away, and is caught by her hair by Bhīma, whom Yudhiṣṭhira seizes. The ludicrous error
is discovered, and Draupadī binds up at last her locks. Arjuna and Vāsudeva arrive,
the Cārvāka has been slain by Nakula, and all is well.
</p>
<p>The play is on the whole undramatic, for the action is choked <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>by narrative, and the vast abundance of detail served up in this form confuses and
destroys interest. Yet the characterization is good; Duryodhana, as in the later Indian
tradition, is unlovable; he is proud and arrogant, self-confident, vain, and selfish;
he laughs at Bhānumatī’s fears and has no sympathy for the maternal anxiety of Jayadratha’s
mother. He is suspicious of Droṇa and Açvatthāman, and thus deprives himself of their
effective aid; Karṇa, whose jealous advice he accepts, he leaves to perish. Bhīma
again is a bloodthirsty and boastful bully; Arjuna is equally valiant, but he is less
an undisciplined savage, while Kṛṣṇa intervenes with wise moderation. Yudhiṣṭhira
is, as ever, grave and more concerned with the interest of his subjects than his personal
feelings. Horror and pathos are not lacking, but the love interest is certainly not
effective, and it may be that it was forced on the author by tradition rather than
any thought of producing a real interest of itself. Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa’s slavish fidelity
to rule brought him censure even from Indian critics.
</p>
<p>The style of the play is clear and not lacking either in force or dignity: dismayed
by the dream of Bhānumatī Duryodhana comforts himself.<a class="noteRef" id="n215.1src" href="#n215.1">21</a> An̄giras says:

Kurus has been burned in this fire of battle; the name alone, O king, is left of Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s

</p>
<p>On the other hand, we find in Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa many of the defects of Bhavabhūti, in
special the fondness for long compounds both in Prākrit and in Sanskrit prose<a class="noteRef" id="n217.2src" href="#n217.2">29</a> and the same straining after effect which gives such a description of the battle
as that vouchsafed to Draupadī by Bhīma, when she warns him nor to be overrash in
battle:<a class="noteRef" id="n217.3src" href="#n217.3">30</a>

the chariots that are sunk in the mud of the blood, fat, <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>flesh, and brains of the elephants shattered in mutual onslaught.’ The adaptation
of sound to sense here is doubtless admirable, and the picture drawn is vivid in a
painful degree, but the style is too laboured to be attractive to modern taste.
</p>
<p>None the less Nārāyaṇa has the merit, shared by Viçākhadatta, of fire and energy;
much of the fierce dialogue is brutal and violent, but it lives with a reality and
warmth which is lacking in the tedious contests in boasting, which burden all the
descriptions in the Rāma dramas of the meeting of Rāma and Paraçurāma. Duryodhana
is not behind Bhīma himself in insolence, though perhaps more subtle than that of
the violent son of the Wind-god:<a class="noteRef" id="n218.1src" href="#n218.1">31</a>

was wrought by the kings whom thou hast slain? When thou hast not conquered me, why
vainly dost thou boast of the cumbrous strength of thy huge arms?’
</p>
<p>Violent as is the language, there is some excuse for it in the extraordinarily heartless
character of Bhīma’s address to the ill-fated Dhṛtarāṣṭra, which almost justifies
the recalling of the disgraceful slight put on Draupadī:<a class="noteRef" id="n218.2src" href="#n218.2">32</a>

<p>These and many other passages are cited by the writers on poetics who find in the
<i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i> an inexhaustible mine of illustration of the theory which doubtless deeply affected
the author in his composition. They do not, however, eulogize him blindly; the love

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sanskrit and the Prākrits offer no special features of interest. The latter is
mainly in Çaurasenī, but the speeches of the Rākṣasa and his wife at the beginning
of Act III are clearly in Māgadhī; they show the characteristic signs of <i>e</i> for the nominative singular, both masculine and neuter, of <i>a</i>-stems; <i>l</i> for <i>r</i>, and <i>ā</i> in the vocative of <i>a</i>-stems. The suggestion of Grill<a class="noteRef" id="n219.2src" href="#n219.2">35</a> that the dialect is more precisely Ardha-Māgadhī is not necessary, for the points
enumerated—the presence of <i>s</i> beside <i>ç</i>, the variation of <i>o</i> and <i>aṁ</i> in the nominative for <i>e</i>, and the use of <i>jj</i> for <i>ry</i>, and not <i>yy</i>—can be explained readily by the error of the scribes or the mistakes of the author.
The freedom with which those worthies acted is seen clearly enough in the fact that
one representative of the Bengālī as opposed to the Devanāgarī recension of the text
has systematically rewritten the Prākrit into Çaurasenī.
</p>
<p>The metrical treatment is noteworthy for the almost equal use of Vasantatilaka (39),
Çārdūlavikrīḍita (32), Çikhariṇī (35), and Sragdharā (20). There are 53 Çlokas, and
a few stanzas of Mālinī, Puṣpitāgrā, Praharṣiṇī, and one each of Aupacchandasika,
Vaitālīya, Indravajrā, and Drutavilambita, with 6 Āryās, and 2 Prākrit Vaitālīyas.
The versification is thus decidedly of the later type.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We know definitely of very few dramatists of the eighth and ninth centuries. Kalhaṇa<a class="noteRef" id="n220.1src" href="#n220.1">1</a> mentions expressly Yaçovarman of Kanyakubja as a patron of literature, who, as we
have seen, patronized Bhavabhūti and Vākpati, and we learn of his drama <i>Rāmābhyudaya</i>, which is mentioned by Ānandavardhana in the <i>Dhvanyāloka</i>, by Dhanika and Viçvanātha, but has not yet been found. To Kalhaṇa<a class="noteRef" id="n220.2src" href="#n220.2">2</a> also we are indebted for knowledge of the period of Çivasvāmin, who lived under Avantivarman
of Kashmir (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 855–83) and was a contemporary of the poet Ratnākara. He wrote many Nāṭakas and Nāṭikās,
and also Prakaraṇas, but save an occasional verse in the anthologies his fame is lost.
</p>
<p>Anan̄gaharṣa Mātrarāja,<a class="noteRef" id="n220.3src" href="#n220.3">3</a> on the other hand, is known to Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta, and his play <i>Tāpasavatsarājacarita</i> is a variation on the theme of the ruse of Yaugandharāyaṇa to secure the marriage
of Vatsa and Padmāvatī, in face of the deep love of the king for Vāsavadattā. Vatsa
in this drama, which is of little poetic or dramatic value, becomes an ascetic on
learning of his queen’s supposed fate, whence the title of the play. Padmāvatī, who
had become enamoured of the king from a portrait sent by the minister, follows suit.
Eventually Vāsavadattā and Vatsa are united in Prayāga when each is about to commit
suicide in sorrow at separation, and the usual victory is reported by Rumaṇvant to
give a happy ending. <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>There seems little doubt that the author used the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, which gives the upper limit of his date. His father’s name is given <span class="corr" id="xd32e9001" title="Source: at">as</span> Narendravardhana.
</p>
<p>Māyurājā<a class="noteRef" id="n221.1src" href="#n221.1">4</a> has been less fortunate in that his <i>Udāttarāghava</i> is known only by reference. Rājaçekhara represents him as a Karaculi or Kulicuri,
which suggests the possibility that he was a king of the Kalacuri dynasty, of which
unhappily we know little during the period in which he is probably to be set. He seems
to have known Bhavabhūti. Like him he eliminated treachery from the slaying of Vālin
by Rāma, and he represents Lakṣmaṇa as first to follow the magic gazelle, and Rāma
as going later in pursuit. He is cited more than once in Dhanika’s commentary on the
<i>Daçarūpa</i>.
</p>
<p>No other dramatist of this period is known with any certainty; the <i>Pārvatīpariṇaya</i> once ascribed to Bāṇa is now allotted to Vāmana Bhaṭṭa Bāṇa (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1400), and the <i>Mallikāmāruta</i>, wrongly thought to be Daṇḍin’s, is the work of one Uddaṇḍin of the seventeenth century.
</p>
<p>Of these dramatists Yaçovarman has had the honour of being considered worthy of quotation
by the writers on theory who have preserved for us some interesting verses:<a class="noteRef" id="n221.2src" href="#n221.2">5</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>ākrandāḥ stanitair vilocanajalāny açrāntadhārāmbhubhis</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>tvadvicchedabhuvaç ca çokaçikhinas tulyās taḍidvibhramaiḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>antar me dayitāmukhaṁ tava çaçī vṛttiḥ samāpy āvayoḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>tat kim mām aniçaṁ sakhe jaladhara dagdhum evodyataḥ.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘My moans are like thy thunder, the floods of my tears thy ever-streaming showers,
the flame of my sorrow at severance from my beloved thy flickering lightning, in my
mind is her face reflected, in thee the moon; like is our condition; why then, O friend,
O cloud, dost thou ever seek to consume me with the burning pangs of love?’
</p>
<p>This is decidedly pretty, and there is elegance and beauty in another verse:<a class="noteRef" id="n221.3src" href="#n221.3">6</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>yat tvannetrasamānakānti salile magnaṁ tad indīvaram</i> </p>

<p class="line"><i>tvatsādṛçyavinodamātram api me daivena na kṣamyate.</i> </p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first">‘The blue lotus which rivalled thine eyes in beauty is now sunk in the lake; the moon
which imitated the fairness of thy face, beloved, is hidden by the clouds; the royal
swans which aped thy lovely gait are departed; cruel fate will not grant me even the
consolation of thy similitude.’
</p>
<p>This verse is appropriated by the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i>, and so is the following,<a class="noteRef" id="n222.1src" href="#n222.1">7</a> which deals elegantly enough with the commonplace contrast between the sad lover
and the Açoka tree, whose name is interpreted as ‘sorrowless’, and which flowers,
as the poets never weary in telling us, when touched by the foot of a fair lady<span class="corr" id="xd32e9080" title="Not in source">,</span> especially one young:

Sorrowless, the creator hath made me a man of sorrows.’

</div>
<p class="first">‘I have not recked of the wound given by love, the hunter, for the memory of thee
hath been my elixir; the fire of separation hath not consumed me straightway because
of the nectar of the hope of union with thee; all this day hath been spent by me in
limning thy fancied form; nought else have I done, as thou thyself art witness, for
dost thou not live in my heart?’ We may regret the loss of a work which contained
verses as pretty as these, even on the outworn topic of Rāma and Sītā.
</p>
<p>It might be interesting to know whether Yaçovarman was successful in introducing any
new element into the established plot. The play is cited in the commentary on the
<i>Daçarūpa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n222.3src" href="#n222.3">9</a> to illustrate the device called deception or humiliation (<i>chalana</i>) and the parallel cited is that of the treatment of Vāsavadattā in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span><i>Ratnāvalī</i>. The definitions of the theory leave this idea far from clear; Viçvanātha seems to
treat it as the bearing of insult for the sake of the end to be reached, and the allusion
in the case of Sītā may be to her abandonment by Rāma as an act of duty.
</p>
<p>A much less favourable impression is left by the few fragments of the <i>Udāttarāghava</i> which are preserved. The poet seems to have affected the horrible, as two of his
few stanzas deal with it; the better is:<a class="noteRef" id="n223.1src" href="#n223.1">10</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">

whose gaping jaws belch flame, utter these piercing cries?<span class="corr" id="xd32e9148" title="Not in source">’</span>
</p>
<p>A somewhat flat passage illustrates the conflict of thought in Rāma’s mind when appealed
to by Citramāya on the score that Lakṣmaṇa is in danger from a Rākṣasa:<a class="noteRef" id="n223.2src" href="#n223.2">11</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">

<p class="first">‘The boy is an ocean of valour; how can I fear danger for him from a Rākṣasa? Yet
the sage here is terrified and calls for aid, and my own mind is confused; my master
too in his affection ever begs me not to leave Janaka’s daughter alone; my heart is
troubled, and in my confusion I cannot resolve either to go or to stay.’
</p>
<p>Another Rāma drama, the <i>Chalitarāma</i>, is also referred to by Dhanika in his comment on the <i>Daçarūpa</i>; it may belong to this period, or fall somewhat later; we have from it a picture
of the leading captive of Lava:<a class="noteRef" id="n223.3src" href="#n223.3">12</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">

play, who amused himself by stealing and giving back strings of beads and bracelets,
he, your heart’s joy, his shoulder pierced by arrows, powerless through entry into
the dread darkness of fainting, is being led away bound, even Lava.’
</p>
<p>Another stanza refers to Bharata; Rāma returning to Ayodhyā in the celestial chariot
declines thus to enter the town, since it is not his, but under the rule of Bharata;
scarcely has he descended when he sees before him his brother:<a class="noteRef" id="n224.1src" href="#n224.1">13</a>

</div>
<p class="first">‘There stands some one, below the lion throne, before a pair of sandals, wearing his
hair long, bearing a rosary, resplendent beneath the chowrie.’
</p>
<p>The same play<a class="noteRef" id="n224.2src" href="#n224.2">14</a> contains an amusing slip by Sītā where she bids her boys go to Ayodhyā and tender
their respects to the king. Lava naturally replies by asking why they should become
members of the king’s entourage, and Sītā answers because the king is their father,
a slip which she explains away as well as she can by saying that the king is father
of the whole earth.
</p>
<p>Yet another drama of which we know nothing else is revealed to us by Dhanika, the
<i>Pāṇḍavānanda</i>, from which is cited a stanza interesting in its series of questions and answers,
a literary form of which the dramatists are fond:<a class="noteRef" id="n224.3src" href="#n224.3">15</a>
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>kā çlāghyā guṇināṁ kṣamā paribhavaḥ ko yaḥ svakulyaiḥ kṛtaḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>kiṁ duḥkhaṁ parasaṁçrayo jagati kaḥ çlāghyo ya āçrīyate</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>ko mṛtyur vyasanaṁ çucaṁ jahati ke yair nirjitāḥ çatravaḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>kair vijñātam idaṁ Virāṭanagare channasthitaiḥ Pāṇḍavaiḥ.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘For the good what is there praiseworthy? Patience. What is disgrace? That which is
wrought by those of one’s own blood. What is misery? Recourse to another’s protection.
Who in the world is enviable? He to whom one resorts for aid. What is death? Misfortune.
Who escape sorrow? Those who conquer their foes. Who learned this lesson? The Pāṇḍavas
when they dwelt in concealment in the city of Virāṭa.’
</p>
<p>We learn also from Dhanika of two further dramas, of unknown <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>authorship and date; they are mentioned<a class="noteRef" id="n225.1src" href="#n225.1">16</a> as illustrating the two kinds of Prakaraṇa as a dramatic form, the basis of distinction
being whether the heroine is the wife of the hero and therefore a lady of good family
or whether she is a courtesan. Of the latter class we have an example in the <i>Taran̄gadatta</i>, and of the former in the <i>Puṣpadūṣitaka</i>; the latter name occurs in the slightly altered form of Puṣpabhūṣita in the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i>. As an example of the Samavakāra the <i>Daçarūpa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n225.2src" href="#n225.2">17</a> mentions the <i>Samudramanthana</i>, a title doubtless as well as the description of the drama in question.
</p>

<div id="ch10.2" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd32e893">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>Murāri</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Murāri tells us that he was the son of Çrīvardhamānaka of the Maudgalya Gotra and
of Tantumatī; he claims to be a Mahākavi, and arrogates the style of Bāla-Vālmīki.
His date is uncertain; he is certainly later than Bhavabhūti since he cites from the
<i>Uttararāmacarita</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n225.3src" href="#n225.3">18</a> while we have evidence from the anthologies that he was reckoned by some as superior
to Bhavabhūti, apparently his predecessor. A further suggestion as to date may be
derived from the Kashmirian poet Ratnākara,<a class="noteRef" id="n225.4src" href="#n225.4">19</a> who in his <i>Haravijaya</i> makes a clear reference to Murāri as a dramatist, for the effort of Bhattanatha Svamin
to disprove the reference must be deemed completely unsuccessful. As Ratnākara belongs
to the middle of the ninth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, this gives us that period as the latest date for Murāri. Curiously enough, Professor
Konow,<a class="noteRef" id="n225.5src" href="#n225.5">20</a> who accepts the disproof of the reference to Murāri in Ratnākara, admits that the
reference to Murāri in Man̄kha’s <i>Çrīkaṇṭhacarita</i><a class="noteRef" id="n225.6src" href="#n225.6">21</a> (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1135) suggests that he was regarded by that author as earlier than Rājaçekhara, a
fact which accords excellently with his priority to Ratnākara, and is far more important
than the fact that he is not cited by the authors on theory of the eleventh century
<span class="asc">A.D.</span> A further effort to place him late is that of Dr. Hultzsch,<a class="noteRef" id="n225.7src" href="#n225.7">22</a> who infers from verse 3 of the <i>Kaumudīmitrāṇanda</i> of Rāmacandra, pupil of Hemacandra, that that <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>dramatist was a contemporary of Murāri. But the evidence is clearly inadequate; the
words used are perfectly compatible with the fact that Murāri was dead, and there
are grave chronological difficulties in the way of the theory. It is practically impossible
that a contemporary of Rāmacandra could have been cited by Man̄kha at the date of
the <i>Çrīkaṇṭhacarita</i>. Moreover Murāri seems to have been imitated by Jayadeva in the <i>Prasannarāghava</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n226.1src" href="#n226.1">23</a>
</p>
<p>Of his place of activity we know nothing definite. He mentions, however, Māhiṣmatī
as the seat of the Kalacuris, and it has been suggested that this indicates that he
lived under the patronage of a prince of that dynasty at Māhiṣmatī, now Māndhātā on
the Narmadā.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>The Anargharāghava</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Murāri declares in the prologue to the solitary drama, the <i>Anargharāghava</i><a class="noteRef" id="n226.2src" href="#n226.2">24</a> which has come down to us, though quotations show that he wrote other works, that
his aim is to please a public tired of terror, horror, violence, and marvels, by a
composition elevated, heroic, and marvellous throughout, not merely at the close.
He defends his choice of the banal subject of Rāma; his character adds elevation and
charm to the poet’s work, and it would be folly to lay aside so splendid a theme.
The <i>Anargharāghava</i>, however, does little to justify the poet’s confidence in his choice of topic. The
theme, treated already at length by Bhavabhūti, offered no chance of success save
for a great poet, and Murāri was not such a poet save in the estimate of occasional
later writers who extol his depth (<i>gambhīratā</i>) without any shadow of justification.
</p>
<p>Act I shows us Daçaratha in conversation with Vāmadeva. The arrival of the sage Viçvāmitra
is announced; he exchanges with the king hyperbolic compliments of the most tedious
type, but proceeds to business by demanding the aid of Rāma against the Rākṣasas which
are troubling his hermitage. The king hesitates to send one so young and dear into
danger. The sage insists on his obeying the call of duty, and he hands over Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa to the care of the ascetic. The herald announces <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>midday, and the king mourns the loss of his son. In Act II we have first a long-drawn-out
conversation between Çunaḥçepha and Paçumeḍhra, two pupils of Viçvāmitra, which serves
to enlighten us on the history of Vālin, Rāvaṇa, the Rākṣasas, Jāmbavant, Hanumant,
and Tāḍakā. The entr’acte is followed by the appearance of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa who describe
the hermitage and the doings of its occupants, and then the heat of midday. Time,
however, does not trouble the dramatist; though there is no further action and no
interruption in the dialogue, we find ourselves transported to the evening; Viçvāmitra
enters and describes in converse with the boys the sunset. A cry behind the scene
announces the approach of the demoness Tāḍakā; Rāma hesitates to slay a female, but
finally departs for the necessary duty; on his return he has to describe the rising
of the moon. Viçvāmitra then suggests a visit to Janaka of Mithilā, affording an opportunity
for a description of the city and its ruler.
</p>
<p>In Act II only do we reach the motif which Bhavabhūti with far greater skill made
the leading idea of the drama, thus giving it effective unity, so far as the story
permits. The chamberlain of Janaka in conversation with Kalahaṅsikā, one of Sītā’s
suite, lets us know that the princess is now ripe for marriage, and Rāvaṇa seeks her
hand. In the scene that follows the king accompanied by Çatānanda receives Rāma, but
hesitates to put him to the severe test involved in bending Çiva’s bow. Çauṣkala,
Rāvaṇa’s envoy, arrives to demand the maiden’s hand, but indignantly declines the
request that his master should bend the bow. He eulogizes Rāvaṇa whom Rāma depreciates.
Rāma is at last allowed to make the trial; those who remain on the stage describe
his wonderful deed in breaking the bow. He is promised Sītā’s hand, while the other
sons of Daçaratha are also awarded consorts. Çauṣkala departs, menacing revenge. Act
IV shows us Rāvaṇa’s minister Mālyavant lamenting the failure of his scheme to win
Sītā. Çūrpaṇakhā arrives from Videha and tells of the union of Rāma and Sītā. Mālyavant
recognizes that Rāvaṇa will insist on seeking to separate the pair, and he counsels
Çūrpaṇakhā to assume the disguise of Mantharā, the maid of Kaikeyī, with the view
of securing the banishment of Rāma to the forest, where he will be more vulnerable
to attack. <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>He is also cheered by the news given by Çūrpaṇakhā of the approach of Paraçurāma to
Mithilā, whence some gain may accrue to his cause. The following scene shows us Rāma
and Paraçurāma in verbal contest; Rāma is even more polite than in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> which is obviously imitated, while the friends of Rāma carry on a vituperative dialogue
behind the scene without actually appearing. Finally they resolve to fight, for Rāma
has annoyed his rival by reminding him that the flag of his fame won by his destruction
of the Kṣatriyas is worn out and challenging him to mount a new one. The fight itself
takes place off the stage; Sītā, we learn from a voice behind the scenes, is apprehensive
lest Rāma be drawing again his bow to win another maiden. The rivals then appear on
excellent terms; Paraçurāma exchanges farewells with his former interlocutors and
disappears. Then enter Janaka and Daçaratha. The latter is determined to resign his
kingdom to Rāma, but Lakṣmaṇa enters introducing Mantharā who bears a fatal missive
from Kaikeyī, bidding the king grant the two boons of the banishment of Rāma and the
coronation of Bharata. The kings faint; Rāma sends Lakṣmaṇa to tell Sītā, and commends
his father to Janaka.
</p>
<p>In Act V a conversation between Jāmbavant and an ascetic lady, Çravaṇā, tells of the
doings of Rāma until his advent in the forest. Çravaṇā goes to Sugrīva to bespeak
a kindly welcome for the wayfarers, while Jāmbavant overhears a dialogue between Rāvaṇa,
disguised as a juggler, and Lakṣmaṇa. The vulture Jaṭāyu then appears with the grave
news that he has seen Rāvaṇa and Mārīca in the forest; Jāmbavant goes to warn Sugrīva
of the danger, while Jaṭāyu sees the rape of Sītā and pursues the ravisher. After
this entr’acte Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa enter, wandering in grief in vain search. They are
interrupted by a cry and see the friendly forest chief, Guha, assailed by the headless
Kabandha. Lakṣmaṇa rescues him, but, in doing so, knocks off the tree, on which it
was suspended, the skeleton of Dundubhi, to the annoyance of Vālin, who appears, and
after a lengthy conversation challenges Rāma to battle. The fight is described from
the stage by Lakṣmaṇa and Guha; the enemy is slain. Voices from behind the scenes
report the coronation of Sugrīva and his determination to aid Rāma in the recovery
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>Sītā, and Lakṣmaṇa and his friend leave the stage to rejoin their party. In Act VI
Sāraṇa and Çuka, two spies of Rāvaṇa’s describe to Mālyavant the building of the bridge
over the ocean and the advent of Rāma’s army. Voices from behind announce the departure
of Kumbhakarṇa and Meghanāda for battle; in the same way we learn of their fall and
the last exit of Rāvaṇa, whom Mālyavant decides to follow to the field. The final
struggle is described with tedious and tasteless prolixity by two Vidyādharas, Ratnacūḍa
and Hemān̄gada, and with this the Act closes.
</p>
<p>In Act VII we have a determined effort to vie with the close of the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i>. Rāma, Sītā, Lakṣmaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, and Sugrīva proceed in Kubera’s celestial car to
Ayodhyā. But the route is diversified from the simplicity of the model, for the travellers
are taken to the celestial regions to view in all its aspects the mythical mountain
Sumeru and the world of the moon; only then do they commence their journey in its
terrestrial aspect by a description of Siṅhala, distinguished as usual from Lan̄kā;
the route then passes over the Malaya mountains, the forest, the mountain Prasravaṇa,
the Godāvarī, mount Mālyavant, Kuṇḍinīpura in the Mahārāṣṭra country, Kāñcī, Ujjayinī,
Māhiṣmatī, the Yamunā, the Ganges, Vārāṇasī, Mithilā and Campā; the car goes then
west to Prayāga, and later turns east to Ayodhyā, where the priest Vasiṣṭha waits
with Rāma’s brothers to crown him king.
</p>
<p>The demerits of the poem are obvious; there is no attempt to improve on the traditional
narrative, though Vālin is honourably killed; the characters are as stereotyped as
ever. The author, however, delights to overload and elaborate the theme; hyperbole
marks every idea; his mythological knowledge is adequate to enable him to abound in
conceits and plays on words, when he does not sink, as largely in Act III, to mere
commonplace. The taste which invents the visit to the world of the moon and Sumeru
is as deplorable as that which substitutes the dull dialogue between Jāmbavant and
Jaṭāyu for the vigorous conversation of Jaṭāyu and Sampāti in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i>. For dialogue in general Murāri has no taste at all, and what merit his work has
lies entirely in the ability which he shows to handle the Sanskrit language and to
frame sentences of harmonious <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>sound in effective metrical forms. His knowledge of the lexica is obvious, while his
love of the recondite in grammar has won him the fame of being used to illustrate
rare forms by the author of the <i>Siddhāntakaumudī</i>. These linguistic merits have secured him the preference shown for him by modern
taste. Nor indeed can his power of expression be justly denied:<a class="noteRef" id="n230.1src" href="#n230.1">25</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>The Date of Rājaçekhara</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Rājaçekhara, with the usual prolixity of bad poets, is voluble on his personality;
he was of a Mahārāṣṭra Kṣatriya family of the Yāyāvaras, who claimed descent from
Rāma; son of the minister Durduka or Duhika, and of Çīlavatī; grandson of Akālajalada,
and descendant of Surānanda, Tarala, and Kavirāja, all <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>poets of name. He married Avantisundarī of the Cāhamāna family, and was a moderate
Çaiva.<a class="noteRef" id="n232.1src" href="#n232.1">31</a>
</p>
<p>In the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i>, probably his first play since it was produced at the request of his wife, and not
a king, he refers to himself as the teacher of Nirbhaya or Nirbhara, who was clearly
the Pratihāra king, Mahendrapāla of Mahodaya or Kanyakubja, of whom we have records
in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 893 and 907. The <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> was produced at his request. But he seems then to have visited another court, for
the <i>Viddhaçālabhañjikā</i> was produced for the Kalacuri king, Yuvarāja Keyūravarṣa of Tripurī. But, as the
unfinished <i>Bālabhārata</i> was written for Mahīpāla, successor of <span class="corr" id="xd32e9499" title="Source: Mahendrapala">Mahendrapāla</span>, whose records begin in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 914, we may assume that he returned to the court of the Pratihāras and died there.
In the <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> he speaks of six of his works, not apparently including the <i>Viddhaçālabhañjikā</i> and the <i>Bālabhārata</i>, and in fact we have many stanzas from him regarding famous authors, though of course
the proof of derivation from this Rājaçekara is not always complete.
</p>
<p>The <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> shows to perfection Rājaçekhara’s own estimate of himself. He traces his poetic descent
from Vālmīki, through Bhartṛmeṇṭha and Bhavabhūti, but it is not clear that Bhartṛmeṇṭha
must be assumed to have dramatized the work, and the little we know of this obscure
person merely shows that he wrote an epic, the <i>Hayagrīvavadha</i>, while his date is involved in the problems of Vikramāditya and Mātṛgupta.<a class="noteRef" id="n232.2src" href="#n232.2">32</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> <i>The Dramas of Rājaçekhara</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n232.3src" href="#n232.3">33</a> is a Mahānāṭaka, that is one in ten acts, and the author, to add to the horror of
the length, has expanded the prologue to almost the dimensions of an act, celebrating
his non-existent merits, and has expanded each act to almost the dimensions of a Nāṭikā.
The whole has 741 stanzas, and of these no less than 203 are in the 19-syllable <span class="corr" id="xd32e9532" title="Source: Çārdūlavikrīdita">Çārdūlavikrīḍita</span> and 89 in the Sragdharā, which has two more syllables in each pada or 84 in a stanza.
The play has a certain novelty, because <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>the author has made the love of Rāvaṇa the dominating feature. He appears in person
in the first act, but declines to test himself by drawing Çiva’s bow, and departs,
menacing evil to any husband of Sītā. In Act II he seeks the aid of Paraçurāma, but
is insulted instead, and a battle barely prevented by intervention of friends. In
Act III the marriage of Sītā is enacted before him to distract his amorous sorrow,
but the attempt is as little a success as it deserved to be; he interrupts, and finally
the scene has to be broken off. In Act IV the duel of Rāma and Paraçurāma is disposed
of, but in Act V we find another ludicrous effort to amuse Rāvaṇa; dolls with parrots
in their mouths are presented to him as Sītā and his foster sister; he is deceived
until he finds that his grasp is on wood; distracted, he demands his beloved from
nature, the seasons, the streams, and the birds, as does Purūravas in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>. The arrival of Çūrpaṇakhā, his sister, who has suffered severely from her attack
on Rāma, brings him to a condition of more manly rage. A tedious Act then carries
matters down to the death of the sorrowing Daçaratha. In Act VII the problem of inducing
the ocean to accept the burden of the bridge is solved; Dadhittha and Kapittha, two
monkeys, describe at length its construction to Rāma. A momentary terror is caused
by a stratagem of Mālyavant; the severed head of Sītā seems to be flung on the shore,
but it speaks and reveals the fraud; it is the head of the speaking doll. In Act VIII
we have Rāvaṇa’s impressions as disaster after disaster is announced; he sends out
Kumbhakarṇa, but sees even him helpless, despite his magic weapons, before Rāma. In
Act IX Indra himself describes the last desperate duel of Rāma and Rāvaṇa. In Act
X the party of Rāma makes the usual aerial tour of India, including the world of the
moon, and ending with the inevitable consecration.
</p>
<p>The <i>Bālabhārata</i><a class="noteRef" id="n233.1src" href="#n233.1">34</a> is mercifully unfinished; it covers the marriage of Draupadī, and the gambling scene
with the ill usage of Draupadī. The other two plays are really Nāṭikās, but the first,
the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i><a class="noteRef" id="n233.2src" href="#n233.2">35</a> is classed by the theory as a Saṭṭaka, simply because it is in Prākrit, none of the
characters <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>speaking Sanskrit. It is the old story; here the king is Caṇḍapāla, possibly a compliment
to Mahendrapāla, and his beloved the Kuntala princess, Karpūramañjarī, who is really
a cousin of the queen. In Act I a magician, Bhairavānanda, displays the damsel to
the king and queen; the apparition tells her tale, and the queen decides to add her
to the number of her attendants. The king and the maiden fall at once in love. In
Act II a letter from the maiden avows her passion, and the Vidūṣaka and her friend
Vicakṣaṇā arrange to let the king see her swinging and also producing by her touch
the blossoming of the Açoka. Between the Acts we must assume that the queen has found
out the love, and has confined the maiden, while the king has secured the making of
a subterranean passage giving access to her prison. In Act III by this means the princess
and the king enjoy a flirtation in the garden, when the queen discovers them. In Act
IV we find that the end of the passage giving on the garden has been blocked, but
another passage has been made to the sanctuary of Cāmuṇḍā, the entrance concealed
behind the statue. Thus the prisoner can play a game of hide-and-seek with the queen,
and this enables her to carry out a clever ruse invented by the magician to secure
the queen’s blessing for the wedding. The queen is induced to demand that the king
shall marry a princess of Lāṭa who will secure him imperial rank. She is still at
her home, but the magician will fetch her to the place. The wedding goes on merrily,
but the princess is no other than Karpūramañjarī, and the queen has unwittingly accomplished
the lovers’ desires.
</p>
<p>The same motif is repeated in the <i>Viddhaçālabhañjikā</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n234.1src" href="#n234.1">36</a> which is a regular Nāṭikā. Act I tells us that Candravarman of Lāṭa, vassal of Vidyādharamalla,
has sent to the court of his overlord his daughter Mṛgān̄kāvalī in the guise of his
son and heir. The king, Vidyādharamalla, recounts a dream in the truthful hours of
the morning, in which a beautiful maid had cast a collar of pearls round his neck;
he is haunted by her, and next finds her in sculptured form (<i>çālabhañjikā</i>) in the picture gallery. He has a further glimpse of her in the flesh but no more,
before the heralds announce midday. In Act II we learn that the queen proposes to
marry Kuvalayamālā of Kuntala to the pretended <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>boy, while the Vidūṣaka has been promised by her foster-sister, Mekhalā, marriage
with a lady of the seductive name of Ambaramālā, Air Garland. Imagine his disgust
when she turns out to be a mere slave; the king has to calm him, and together they
watch in hiding Mṛgān̄kāvalī playing in the garden, and hear her reading a letter
of love. The heralds proclaim the evening hour. In Act III we are told that the dream
of the king was reality, devised by Bhāgurāyaṇa, his minister, who knew that the husband
of the heroine would attain imperial rule. The Vidūṣaka punishes Mekhalā’s ruse by
another; he bids a woman hide herself and call out a warning to Mekhalā of evil to
befall her unless she crawl between a Brahmin’s limbs. The queen begs the Vidūṣaka
to permit this ceremony, and, it over, he avows the plot to the great indignation
of the queen. The Vidūṣaka and the king then have an interview with the heroine. In
Act IV we learn of a plot of the queen to punish the king. She induces him to agree
to marry the sister of the pretended boy, meaning that he should find that he has
married a boy. The king agrees; the marriage is completed; news comes from Candravarman
that a son is born, begging the queen to dispose in marriage of his daughter, who
may resume her sex. The queen, tricked and deceived, makes the best of her situation;
with dignity and hauteur she bestows on her husband both Mṛgān̄kāvalī and Kuvalayamālā,
while news is brought that the last rebels are subdued and the king’s suzerainty is
recognized everywhere.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt of the demerits of Rājaçekhara’s works; he is devoid of the
power to create a character: Vidyādharamalla is stiff and uninteresting beside his
model, the gay and gallant Vatsa; the queen is without the love or the majesty of
Vāsavadattā; Bhāgurāyaṇa is a feeble Yaugandharāyaṇa, whose magician is borrowed in
the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> and spoiled in the borrowing. The heroines are without merit; the Vidūṣaka in the
<i>Karpūramañjarī</i> is tedious, but Cārāyaṇa in the <i>Viddhaçālabhañjikā</i> has merits; he has plenty of sound common sense, though he is simple and capable
of being taken in by others. The intrigue in both Nāṭikās is poorly managed; the confusion
of exits and entrances in the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> is difficult to follow and probably more difficult to act, while in the <i>Viddhaçālabhañjikā</i> the queen is induced to arrange a marriage out of a <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>puerile incident affecting the Vidūṣaka only. The taste of giving two brides to the
king at once is deplorable, as is the failure to explain why the king accepts the
suggested marriage when ignorant of its true import.
</p>
<p>In all his dramas, however, Rājaçekhara is merely concerned with exercises in style.
The themes he frankly tells us in the prologue to the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> are the same; the question is the expression, and the language is indifferent; therefore
Prākrit being smooth, while Sanskrit is harsh, the language of women as opposed to
men, can be used as a medium of style by one who boasts himself an expert in every
kind of language. We have, therefore, elaborate descriptions in equally elaborate
verses, of the dawn, midday, sunset, the pleasures of the harem, the game of ball,
the swing, a favourite enjoyment of the Indian maidens, and in the Nāṭakas pictures
<i>ad nauseam</i> of battles with magic weapons, and appalling mythical geography and topography. His
allusions to local practices and customs may be interesting to the antiquarian, but
are not poetical. More praiseworthy is his real accomplishment in metres, especially
the Çārdūlavikrīḍita, his facility in which Kṣemendra justly praises, the Vasantatilaka,
Çloka, and Sragdharā. His ability to handle elaborate Prākrit metres is undeniable;
in 144 stanzas in the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> he has 17 varieties. If poetry consisted merely of harmonious sound, he must be ranked
high as a poet. He is fond of proverbs: <i>varaṁ takkālovaṇadā tittirī ṇa uṇa diahantaridā morī</i>, which gives our ‘A bird in hand is worth two in the bush’; he introduces freely
words from vernaculars, including Marāthī. But, despite his parade of learning, he
cannot distinguish accurately Çaurasenī and Māhārāṣṭrī in his drama; in the former
we find such forms as <i>laṭṭhi</i> for <i>yaṣṭi</i>, <i>ammi</i> in the locative and <i>hiṁto</i> in the ablative singular of <i>a</i>-stems, and <i>esa</i> for the pronoun. Important as he is lexicographically for both Sanskrit and Prākrit,
it is undeniable that both were utterly dead languages for him, which he had laboriously
learned. Forms like <i>ḍhilla</i> equivalent to <i>çithila</i> in the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> show how far the vernaculars had advanced beyond the Prākrits of the drama.
</p>
<p>It would, however, be quite unjust to deny to Rājaçekhara the power of effective expression;
like all the later dramatists he is capable of producing elegant and attractive verses,
which are <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>largely spoiled in their context by their being embedded in masses of tasteless matter.
Thus the benediction of the <i>Viddhaçālabhañjikā</i> is decidedly graceful:

</p>
<p>Of all the plays the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> is undoubtedly that which contains the most substantial evidence that Rājaçekhara
had some real poetic talent, despite the banality and stupidity of his conception
of love in Act III. The swing scene contains really effective lines of word-painting,
in harmonious metre:<a class="noteRef" id="n238.1src" href="#n238.1">37</a>

in a stanza which admirably conveys by its sound the sense at which it aims:

</p>
<p>For technique Rājaçekhara is of interest, because he uses in the <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> the old form of prologue quite openly, with the Nāndī recited doubtless by the Sūtradhāra,
followed by the advent of the Sthāpaka who recites two verses. It is noteworthy that
the manuscripts often alter the Sthāpaka to the Sūtradhāra despite the clear sense
of the text. The late <i>Pārvatīpariṇaya</i> likewise has a Nāndī before the Sūtradhāra speaks a verse. It is probable that the
older technique long persisted in the south.
</p>
<p>Rājaçekhara’s indebtedness to his predecessors is wholesale; the influence of Kālidāsa,
Harṣa, and Bhavabhūti is obvious, and it is probably an indication of his contemporaneity
with, or slight posteriority to, Murāri that he does not seem to have known his writings.
Influence of the vernacular or of Prākrit is to be seen in his occasional use of rhyme,
such as is found in the later <i>Gītagovinda</i> or the <i>Mohamudgara</i>.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">6.</span> <i>Bhīmaṭa and Kṣemīçvara</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A verse attributed to Rājaçekhara mentions the five dramas of Bhīmaṭa, of which the
<i>Svapnadaçānana</i> won him chief fame. He is described as a Kaliñjarapati, whence the suggestion has
been made that he was a connection of the Candella king Harṣa of Jejākabhukti, who,
we know, was a contemporary of Mahīpāla of Kanyakubja, patron of Rājaçekhara, but
we have no ground for positive assertion.<a class="noteRef" id="n239.1src" href="#n239.1">40</a>
</p>
<p>The case is different with Kṣemīçvara, who in his <i>Caṇḍakauçika</i> wrote for Mahīpāla, doubtless the king of Kanyakubja, patron of Rājaçekhara. Kṣemīçvara
asserts his patron’s victory over the Karṇāṭas, which was doubtless the view taken
in royal circles of the contest against the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Indra III, who for his part
claims victory over Mahodaya, or Kanyakubja.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n239.1bsrc" href="#n239.1">40</a> A <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>variant of the name is Kṣemendra, but he is not to be identified with the Kashmirian
poet of that name. His great-grandfather was called Vijayakoṣṭha or Vijayaprakoṣṭha,
who is designated as both Ārya and Ācārya, and was, therefore, a learned man of some
sort.
</p>
<p>Kṣemīçvara has left two dramas. The <i>Naiṣadhānanda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n240.1src" href="#n240.1">41</a> in seven acts deals with the legend of Nala, famous in the epic and later. The <i>Caṇḍakauçika</i><a class="noteRef" id="n240.2src" href="#n240.2">42</a> reveals the stupid story of Hariçcandra, who, seeing as he thought the sacrifice
of a damsel on the fire rebukes the Kauçika Viçvāmitra, and in return for his gallant
action is cursed by the irascible sage, who was merely bringing the sciences under
his control. He secures pardon by the surrender of the earth and a thousand gold pieces;
to secure the latter he sells wife and child to a Brahmin, and himself to a Caṇḍāla
as a cemetery keeper. One day his wife brings the dead body of their child, but it
turns out merely to be a trial of his character; his son is alive and is crowned king.
The plot is as poor as the execution of the piece. He shows in metre a special fondness
for the Çikhariṇī, which occurs 20 times, nearly as often as the Çārdūlavikrīḍita
(23), while the Vasantatilaka appears 27 times and the Çloka 36. His Prākrits, Çaurasenī
and a few <span class="corr" id="xd32e9794" title="Source: Māhārāṣṭri">Māhārāṣṭrī</span> stanzas, are artificial.
</p>
<p>The compilers of anthologies make little of Kṣemīçvara, with sufficient reason, for
his verses do not rise above mediocrity. The second stanza of the three-verse benediction
in the <i>Naiṣadhānanda</i> is on a common theme, but not unhappily expressed; it follows a verse in honour of
Puruṣottama and Çrī, with the usual impartiality of this period:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>asthi hy asthi phaṇī phaṇī kim aparam bhasma bhasmaiva tac</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>carmaiva carma kiṁ tava jitaṁ yenaivam uttāmyasi</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>naitāṁ dhūrta paṇīkaroṣi satatam mūrdhni sthitāṁ Jāhnavīm</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>ity evaṁ Çivayā sanarmagadito dyūte Haraḥ pātu vaḥ.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘A skull is but a skull, a serpent a serpent; what more? The ashes and the skin also
which thou dost wear are but ashes and skin. What of thine hast thou lost that thus
thou art outworn? Ah, rogue, it is that thou wilt not stake Jahnu’s daughter that
<span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>rests ever on thy crest. May Hara guard you, Hara to whom Çivā once spake playfully
when they diced.’
</p>
<p>This amusing play on the unwillingness of Çiva to prolong the dicing after he has
unsuccessfully staked his necklace of skulls and serpents, and his clothing of ashes
and hide, is followed by a wearisome eulogy of the glances of the god in the Tāṇḍava
dance, alluding to the great moments in his history. Similar bad taste is shown in
the curious and unusual form of the last verse of the drama:
</p>
<div lang="und" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>yenādiçya prayogaṁ ghanapulakabhṛtā nāṭakasyāsya harṣād</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>vastrālaṁkārahemnām pratidinam akṛçā rāçayaḥ sampradattāḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>tasya kṣattraprasūter bhramatu jagad idaṁ Kārttikeyasya kīrtiḥ</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>pāre kṣīrāmbhusindho ravikaviyaçasā sārdham agresarena.</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘Through all the universe beyond the ocean of milk, heralded by the fame of his bard,
the sun, may the fame wander of that scion of heroism, that god of war, who bade this
drama be performed and who in keen delight at the pleasure he found in it gave daily
to the poet abundant store of raiment, jewels and gold.’ Such a mode of immortalizing
himself, and his patron can hardly be regarded as precisely dignified, and it certainly
is not in harmony with the traditions of the drama.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have seen already in Murāri and Rājaçekhara the process which was depriving the
drama of real dramatic quality. The older poets were, indeed, under the influence
of the epic; they lived in the atmosphere of the poetry of the court and their dramatic
instincts had always to fight against the tendency to introduce epic and lyric verses
into their works, heedless of the ruin thus wrought on the drama. Had the stage been
a more popular one, this defect might have been counteracted, but the audience for
whose approval a poet looked was essentially one of men of learning, who were intent
on discerning poetic beauties or defects, and who, as the theory proves, had singularly
little idea of what a drama really means.
</p>
<p>Other factors doubtless helped the decline of the drama. The invasion of the Mahomedans
into northern India, which began in earnest with the opening of the eleventh century,
was a slow process, and it could not immediately affect the progress of the dramatic
art. But gradually, by substituting Mahomedan rulers—men who disliked and feared the
influence of the national religion, which was closely bound up with the drama—for
Hindu princes, the generous and accomplished patrons of the dramatists, it must have
exercised a depressing effect on the cultivation of this literary form. The drama
doubtless took refuge in those parts of India where Moslem power was slowest to extend,
but even there Mahomedan potentates gained authority, and drama can have been seldom
worth performing or composing, until the Hindu revival asserted the Indian national
spirit, and gave an encouragement to the renewal of an ancient national glory.
</p>
<p>Yet a further and most important consideration must have lain in the ever-widening
breach between the languages of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>drama and those of real life. In Bhāsa’s days and even those of Kālidāsa we may imagine
that there was not too great difficulty in following the main features of the drama
both in Sanskrit and in Prākrit, but the gulf between the popular languages and those
of learning went on widening every year, and Rājaçekhara, as we have seen, was, despite
his boasted studies, of which we have no reason to doubt, unable to discriminate correctly
his Prākrits. It in no wise disproves this view that the <i>Lalitavigraharājanāṭaka</i> of Somadeva shows a close connexion with the language as laid down in Hemacandra’s
grammar, for, as that work preceded the play in date and was produced at the court
of Aṇhilvāḍ, which was in close connexion with that of Sambhār, where Somadeva lived,
we need not doubt that copies of Hemacandra’s work were available for the production
of artificial Prākrit.
</p>
<p>It was clearly a very different thing to compose in Sanskrit and Prākrit in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1000, when the vernaculars were beginning to assume literary form, than in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 400, and the difficulty of composition in any effective manner must have rapidly
increased with the years, and the growth of the realization that it was idle to seek
fame under modern circumstances by the composition of dramas, for which there was
no popular audience and only a limited market. What is amazing is that for centuries
the Sanskrit drama continued to be produced in very substantial numbers, as the existence
of manuscripts proves, and that so strong was the force of tradition that the first
attempt to introduce the vernacular into the drama by Bidyāpati Ṭhākur in Behar took
the form of producing works in which the characters use Sanskrit and Prākrit and the
songs only are in Maithilī. So powerful has been the strength of the Sanskrit drama
that it is only in the nineteenth century that vernacular drama has exhibited itself
in Hindi, and in general it is only very recently that the drama has seemed proper
for vernacular expression. But the writing in artificial languages has revenged itself
on the writers; their works are reminiscent of modern copies of Greek or Latin verses,
which only too painfully reveal through all the artifices suggested by careful study
the impossibility of the production of real poetry, not to mention drama, in dead
languages. It is significant in this regard that perhaps the most interesting of later
dramas is the <i>Prabodhacandrodaya</i> of Kṛṣṇamiçra, a <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>drama of allegory on philosophical topics, which claim as their right Sanskrit as
a mode of expression. The Sanskrit of the author thus represents the medium of his
habitual use in discussions and is appropriate to the matters dealt with.
</p>
<p>This is essentially the period when the dramatic rules, strong in their hold earlier
over the minds of dramatists, attain even greater sway. It is to this that we owe
the few specimens we have of the rarer types of drama which are not represented among
the scanty remains of the classical drama. There is no reason to suppose that these
types were popular among the earlier dramatists; they had, it seems, their vogue in
the time before the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> assumed its present form, but were rejected as unsuitable by the classical drama.
We have also specimens of types which may have been regularly produced in classical
times, but none of which are represented in the extant literature. Finally, we have
specimens of new forms, the result of efforts to introduce into Sanskrit dramatic
forms which had sprung up in more popular circles.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Nāṭaka</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Nāṭaka remains throughout the post-classical period of the drama the natural exponent
of the higher form of the dramatic art. No change of importance appears in its character;
it merely steadily develops those features which we have seen in full process of production
in Murāri and Rājaçekhara, the subordination of action to description, and the degeneration
of the description into a mere exercise in style and in the use of sounds.
</p>
<p>The character of the decline is obvious enough in the <i>Prasannarāghava</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n244.1src" href="#n244.1">1</a> a Nāṭaka in seven Acts, in which the logician Jayadeva (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1200), son of Mahādeva and Sumitrā, of Kuṇḍina in Berar, endeavours to tell again
the story of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n244.2src" href="#n244.2">2</a> In Act I a disciple of Yājñavalkya appears and repeats from the speech of two bees
heard behind the scene the news they are discussing; the Asura Bāṇa is to rival Rāvaṇa
for the hand of <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>Sītā. Two heralds then appear to describe the suitors for the maiden’s hand; they
are interrupted and insulted by a gross and rough arrival who casts a contemptuous
eye on the bow which the suitor must bend, and would forcibly seize the prize. The
heralds soothe him, but he assumes the monstrous form of Rāvaṇa with his ten heads.
Bāṇa then appears, tries in vain the bow, insults Rāvaṇa and retires. In Act II we
have a ludicrous scene in which Rāma watches Sītā and her friend; both he and she
describe the beauties of the union of the Vāsantī creeper and the mango-tree, an allusion
to their own state to be, and confronted shyly whisper love. In Act III we have an
intolerable series of compliments exchanged by all the parties, Viçvāmitra, Çatānanda,
Janaka, Daçaratha, Rāma, and Lakṣmaṇa; Viçvāmitra bids Rāma bend the bow of Çiva,
though a message from Paraçurāma deprecates such an insult. The bow is broken, there
is great joy, and the marriage is celebrated. In Act IV Paraçurāma himself arrives;
his great feats are set out in a dialogue of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa; he encounters them,
exchanges harangues, is dissuaded by Janaka, Çatānanda, and Viçvāmitra from battle,
but an insult of his to Viçvāmitra breaks down Rāma’s patience; they fight, Rāma is
victor, but falls at his rival’s feet and asks his blessing. In Act V we have a new
and picturesque conception and one wholly aloof from drama. The river goddess Yamunā
tells Gan̄gā of her grief at Vālin’s act in exiling his brother, Sugrīva. Sarayū joins
them and reports the fate of Rāma until his departure for exile; her flamingo arrives
to carry on the tale until Rāma’s fatal departure in pursuit of a golden deer. Anxious,
the rivers hasten to the ocean, Sāgara, to learn the news; they find Godāvarī in converse
with Sāgara; she tells of the rape of Sītā, the death of Jaṭāyu, the fall of Sītā’s
jewels and their transport to Ṛṣyamukha. The Tun̄gabhadrā arrives with her tale; Rāma
has slain Vālin and made alliance with Sugrīva and Hanumant. Suddenly a great mass
flies over the ocean. Is it the Himālaya? the Vindhya? Sāgara goes out to see and
the rivers follow. In Act VI we find that sorrow has all but driven Rāma mad; he asks
the birds, the moon, for his beloved. Fortunately two Vidyādharas by magic art are
able to show him the events in Lan̄kā; Sītā appears, saddened lest Rāma suspect, or
be faithless to her; Rāvaṇa seeks her love; she <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>despises him; angry, he reaches out his hand for his sword to slay her, but receives
in it the head of his son, Akṣa, slain by Hanumant, who it is who has leaped the ocean
and attacked Lan̄kā. Sītā is desperate; she seeks to burn herself on a funeral pyre,
but the coal changes to pearl, and Hanumant consoles her by news of Rāma’s fidelity.
In Act VII Rāvaṇa is given by Prahasta a picture sent by Mālyavant showing the details
of the enemy’s attack and the bridge; he refuses to regard it as more than a painter’s
fancy; Mandodarī, his wife, enters; she has received an oracular response which terrifies
her and also Prahasta, but Rāvaṇa scorns it. At last, however, he realizes that the
city is attacked, sends Kumbhakarṇa and Meghanāda to their death, and at last himself
issues forth to die; his fate is described by a Vidyādhara and his mate. Then enter
Rāma, Sītā, Lakṣmaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, and Sugrīva, who all describe in turn the setting
of the sun and the rise of the moon; they mount the aerial car, describe a few points
of interest in the country over which they pass in their journey north, and then in
turn solemnly describe the rising of the sun.
</p>
<p>The play is typical of the later drama; its one merit is Act V where the spectacle
of the river goddesses grouped round the ocean affords admirable scope for an effective
tableau, but it is wholly out of harmony with dramatic action. As usual, the author
is fond of the long metres, though the Vasantatilaka is his favourite; then comes
the Çārdūlavikrīḍita, Çloka, Çikhariṇī, and Sragdharā, while he shows decided fondness
for the Svāgatā, which occurs a few times in Rājaçekhara and the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i>, but is not employed in the earlier drama. The drama is superior in merit to the
other very popular Rāma drama, the <i>Jānakīpariṇaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n246.1src" href="#n246.1">3</a> by Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita, who flourished and wrote many bad works at the end of the
seventeenth century. The number of Rāma dramas already known is enormous; any one
of merit appears still to be unearthed. The commentary on the <i>Daçarūpa</i> knows a <i>Chalitarāma</i> which would probably date before <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1000, but its preservation is problematical. The <i>Adbhutadarpaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n246.2src" href="#n246.2">4</a> of Mahādeva, son of Kṛṣṇa Sūri, a contemporary of Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita, shows Jayadeva’s
influence in that it presents the events <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>at Lan̄kā as happening by means of a magic mirror. Its ten acts cover only the period
from An̄gada’s mission to Rāvaṇa to the coronation of Rāma, and it introduces, contrary
to the rule in Rāma dramas, the figure of the Vidūṣaka.
</p>
<p>The Kṛṣṇa legend naturally attracted not less note; the Kerala prince Ravivarman,
born in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1266, is the author of a <i>Pradyumnābhyudaya</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n247.1src" href="#n247.1">5</a> The minister of Husain Shāh Rūpa Gosvāmin wrote about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1532 the <i>Vidagdhamādhava</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.2src" href="#n247.2">6</a> and the <i>Lalitamādhava</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.3src" href="#n247.3">7</a> in seven and ten Acts respectively on the theme of the loves of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā,
in pursuance of his eager support of the movement of Caitanya. For the son of Ṭodar
Mall, Akbar’s minister, Çeṣa Kṛṣṇa wrote the <i>Kaṅsavadha</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.4src" href="#n247.4">8</a> which in seven Acts covers the ground of Bhāsa’s <i>Bālacarita</i>, as well as other plays on the Rāma legend. The winning of Rukmiṇī by Kṛṣṇa is the
theme of the <i>Rukmiṇīpariṇaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.5src" href="#n247.5">9</a> by Rāmavarman of Travancore (1735–87), and Kṛṣṇa’s generosity to a poor friend, though
in a surprising shape, is recounted by Sāmarāja Dīkṣita in the <i>Çrīdāmacarita</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.6src" href="#n247.6">10</a> written in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1681.
</p>
<p>The number of dramas based on the <i>Mahābhārata</i> is decidedly smaller. We have not the <i>Citrabhārata</i> of the indefatigable Kṣemendra of Kashmir, who wrote in the middle of the eleventh
century. But from that century probably are the <i>Subhadrādhanaṁjaya</i> and <i>Tapatīsaṁvaraṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.7src" href="#n247.7">11</a> of the Kerala king Kulaçekharavarman, and from about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1200 the <i>Pārthaparākrama</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n247.8src" href="#n247.8">12</a> a Vyāyoga, to be discussed hereafter, of Prahlādanadeva, a Yuvarāja, brother of Dhārāvarṣa,
lord of Candrāvatī.
</p>
<p>Of other mythological subjects we have the <i>Harakelināṭaka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.9src" href="#n247.9">13</a> of the Cāhamāna king Vīsaladeva Vigraharāja, of whom we have an inscription of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1163, and whose work is partially preserved on stone. The <i>Pārvatīpariṇaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.10src" href="#n247.10">14</a> of Vāmana Bhaṭṭa Bāṇa, who wrote about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1400 under the Reḍḍi prince Vema of Koṇḍavīḍu, owes its fame to its being mistaken
for a work of Bāṇa. The <i>Haragaurīvivāha</i><a class="noteRef" id="n247.11src" href="#n247.11">15</a> of Jagajjyotirmalla of Nepal (1617–33) is interesting, because it is rather an opera
than a play and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>vernacular verses are its only fixed element, but this is not likely to be a primitive
feature.
</p>
<p>Of dramas with lesser personages of the saga as heroes we have the <i>Bhairavānanda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n248.1src" href="#n248.1">16</a> of the Nepalese poet Maṇika from the end of the fourteenth century, and at least
a century later the <i>Bhartṛharinirveda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n248.2src" href="#n248.2">17</a> of Harihara, which is interesting, as it shows the popularity of Bhartṛhari; he is
represented as desolated by his wife’s death, through despair on a false rumour of
his own death, but, consoled by a Yogin, he attains indifference, so that, when his
wife is recalled to life, neither she nor their child has any attraction for him.
</p>
<p>Of historical drama we have little, and that of small value. The <i>Lalitavigraharājanāṭaka</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n248.3src" href="#n248.3">18</a> preserved in part in an inscription, is a work of the latter part of the twelfth
century by Somadeva in honour of Vīsaladeva Vigraharāja, the Cāhamāna. The <i>Pratāparudrakalyāṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n248.4src" href="#n248.4">19</a> by <span class="corr" id="xd32e10055" title="Source: Vidyānatha">Vidyānātha</span>, inserted in his treatise on rhetoric as an illustration of the drama, celebrates
his patron, a king of Warangal about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1300.
</p>
<p>More interesting is the <i>Hammīramadamardana</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n248.5src" href="#n248.5">20</a> written between <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1219 and 1229 by Jayasiṅha Sūri, the priest of the temple of Munisuvrata at Broach.
It appears that Tejaḥpāla, brother of Vastupāla, minister of Vīradhavala of Gujarāt,
visited the temple, and, with the assent of his brother, complied with the request
of Jayasiṅha for the erection of twenty-five golden flagstaffs for Devakulikās. As
a reward Jayasiṅha not merely celebrated the brothers in a panegyric, of which a copy
has been preserved along with his drama, but wrote, to please Jayantasiṅha, son of
Vastupāla, the play for performance at the festival of the procession of the god Bhīmeçvara
at Cambay. He claims that it includes all nine sentiments, in contrast to Prakaraṇas,
exploiting the sentiment of fear, with which the audience has been surfeited.
</p>
<p>In Act I, after the introductory dialogue between the Sūtradhāra and an actor, Vīradhavala
is brought in, conversing with Tejaḥpāla, the theme being the extraordinary merits
of Vastupāla <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>as a statesman. But times are still troublous; the realm is menaced by the Turuṣka
Hammīra, by the Yādava Siṅhana,<a class="noteRef" id="n249.1src" href="#n249.1">21</a> who may hope for aid from Saṁgrāmasiṅha, nephew of Siṅha, lord of Lāṭa. Vastupāla
enters, and extols the skill of Tejaḥpāla’s son Lāvaṇyasiṅha, whose spies bring in
valuable information. He then with Tejaḥpāla compliments the king, who tells them
of his proposed attack on Hammīra. Vastupāla warns him against excessive valour in
pursuit, and counsels him to secure the aid of the Mārvār princes. In Act II we find
that the advice has been followed with success, as related by Lāvaṇyasiṅha, who has
an opportunity of repaying the compliments showered on him by his uncle. The spy Nipuṇaka
then enters with a tale of success; he has entered Siṅhana’s camp, passed himself
off as a spy on Vīradhavala’s movements, reported that that king was making ready
an attack on Hammīra, and persuaded Siṅhana to wait in the forest of the Tapti a favourable
opportunity to attack Vīradhavala, after his forces have been weakened by battle with
Hammīra. In the meantime Nipuṇaka’s brother Suvega, who has been serving Devapāla
of Mālava, steals the best steed of his master and presents it to Saṁgrāmasiṅha, who
is leading Siṅhana’s army. He then presents himself in the guise of a Tāpasa to Siṅhana,
but runs away when the king goes to pay him due honour. Suspicion is thus aroused,
and Suvega is seized; from his matted locks is extracted a letter addressed to Saṁgrāmasiṅha.
It refers to the horse which it treats as a present from Devapāla to Saṁgrāmasiṅha,
and advises him to attack Siṅhana when he has entered Gujarāt, the Mālava king engaging
to assail him at that moment. Siṅhana asks Nipuṇaka to ascertain the truth about the
horse, and he has no difficulty through Suvega in terrifying Saṁgrāmasiṅha into flight.
We then find Vastupāla on the stage; his spy Kuçalaka reports that Saṁgrāmasiṅha menaces
Cambay; Vastupāla takes precautions for its defence, and summons Bhuvanapāla, Saṁgrāmasiṅha’s
minister, with whom he arrives at an understanding, assuring Vīradhavala of that prince’s
aid. In Act III Vīradhavala and Tejaḥpāla hear from a spy Kamalaka the fate of Mewār’s
king Jayatala; attacked by the Mlecchas, the people in despair flung <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>themselves into wells, burned themselves in their houses or hanged themselves, until
he had heartened them and discouraged the foe by announcing the approach of Vīradhavala,
at whose name the Turuṣkas fled in terror. Vīradhavala extols the cleverness of Vastupāla,
who has enabled him to dispose of all his enemies save the Mlecchas, and Tejaḥpāla
assures him of <span class="corr" id="xd32e10091" title="Source: succes">success</span> even against these foes. What Vastupāla is doing is shown by a conversation between
two spies, Kuvalayaka and Çīghraka, which forms the entr’acte to Act IV; he has induced
the Kaliph of Baghdad by a false report to instruct Kharpara Khāna to send Mīlacchrīkāra
to him in chains, and he has won over various Gūrjara princes by promising them the
lands of the Turuṣkas when they are defeated. We then find Mīlacchrīkāra discussing
his situation with his minister Gorī Īsapa; Kharpara Khāna, on the one hand, and Vīradhavala
press him hard; the king declines, however, even to think of retreat, but both king
and minister flee hastily before the sound of the approach of Vīradhavala’s army and
the voice of the king, who is disappointed not to capture his foes, but obeys loyally
Vastupāla’s counsel against rash pursuit. Act V shows us the triumphant return of
the king, his reunion with his wife Jayataladevī, and exchange of felicitations with
Vastupāla and Tejaḥpāla. We learn that Vastupāla has accomplished a further feat;
he has intercepted at sea Radī and Kadī, Mīlacchrīkāra’s preceptors, returning from
Baghdad, and the king has been forced, in order to secure their safety, to enter into
friendly relations. Finally the king enters Çiva’s temple, where the god presents
himself before him, and grants him a boon; the king, however, has little that is not
formal to ask, so fortunate is he in his ministers.
</p>
<p>Neither as history nor as poetry does the work claim any high merit. Its chief aim
is to provide unlimited eulogy for Vastupāla and Tejaḥpāla, and secondarily for the
king who is lucky enough to have in his retinue these remarkable models of intelligence
and skill. It must be admitted, however, that the author does not exactly convey the
impression of the real success of his objects of admiration; the impression is rather
one of minor successes and a good deal of rather obvious diplomacy. Style, Prākrit,
and metres are decidedly stereotyped.
</p>
<p>A certain number of dramas of similar type has been preserved.<a class="noteRef" id="n250.1src" href="#n250.1">22</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>Gan̄gādhara’s <i>Gan̄gadāsapratāpavilāsa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n251.2src" href="#n251.2">23</a> celebrates the struggle of a Campānīr prince against Muhammed II, Shāh of Gujarāt
(<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1443–52). The stream, though scanty, flows continuously to the <i>Ḍillīsāmrājya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n251.3src" href="#n251.3">24</a> of Lakṣmaṇa Sūri of 1912.
</p>
<p>The adaptation of English drama is seen in R. Kṛṣṇamachari’s adaptation in 1892 of
the <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> in his <i>Vāsantikasvapna</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n251.4src" href="#n251.4">25</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>The Allegorical Nāṭaka</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We cannot say whether Kṛṣṇamiçra’s <i>Prabodhacandrodaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n251.5src" href="#n251.5">26</a> was a revival of a form of drama, which had been practised regularly if on a small
scale since Açvaghoṣa or whether it was a new creation, as may easily have been the
case. At any rate, his work can be dated with precision; it was produced for one Gopāla
in the presence of the Candella king Kīrtivarman of Jejākabhukti, of whom we have
an inscription of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1098. Gopāla had restored, we learn, Kīrtivarman after his defeat by Karṇa of Cedi,
who was living in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1042, but we can only guess that he was a general. The play in its six Acts is devoted
to the defence of the Advaita form of the Viṣṇu doctrine, a combination of Vedānta
with Viṣṇuism.
</p>
<p>The supreme reality which is truly one, but is united with illusion, has a son, Spirit,
who again has two children, Discrimination (<i>viveka</i>) and Confusion (<i>moha</i>); the posterity of the latter has largely gained in strength, and the position of
the former and his offspring is menaced. This is told us at the outset of the drama
by Love in converse with Desire; the former is sure he has done much to attain the
result. The one danger is the old prophecy that there will arise Knowledge (<i>prabodha</i>) and Judgement or Science (<i>vidyā</i>) from the union of Discrimination and Theology, Upaniṣad, but these two are long
since parted, and their reunion seems unlikely. The two, however, flee before the
approach of the king Discrimination who is talking with Reason <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>(<i>mati</i>), one of his wives; to his joy he finds that she is all in favour of his reunion
with Theology which she is fain to bring about. In Act II we find Confusion in fear
of overthrow; he hastens by the use of Falsity (<i>dambha</i>) to secure Benares as the key of the world; Egoism, grandfather of Falsity, visits
the city and discovers to his joy his relative. Confusion enters in triumphant pomp
his new capital; the Materialist Cārvāka supports him. But there is bad news; Duty
is rising in revolt; Theology meditates reunion with Discrimination; Confusion bids
his minions cast Piety, daughter of Faith (<i>çraddhā</i>) in prison and orders Heresy (<i>mithyādṛṣṭi</i>) to separate Theology and Faith. In Act III Piety appears supported by her friend
Pity; she has lost her mother Faith and is in sad plight, even dreaming of suicide,
from which Pity dissuades her. In Digambara Jainism, Buddhism, and Somism she searches
in vain for Faith; each appears with a wife claiming to be Faith, but she cannot recognize
her mother in these distorted forms. Buddhism and Jainism quarrel; Somism enters,
makes them drunk with alcohol and pleasure, and takes them off in search of Piety,
the daughter of Faith. In Act IV Faith in great distress tells of a danger; she and
Duty have escaped from a demoness who would have devoured them but for Trust in Viṣṇu,
who has saved them. She brings a message to Discrimination to start the battle. He
musters his leaders, Contemplation, Patience, Contentment, and himself goes to Benares,
which he describes. In Act V the battle is over; Confusion and his offspring are dead.
But Spirit is disconsolate, mourning the loss of Confusion and Activity. The doctrine
of Vyāsa, the Vedānta, appears, disabuses his mind of error, and he resolves to settle
down as a hermit with the one wife worthy of him, Inactivity. Act VI shows us the
ancestor of all Being; he is still under the influence of Confusion, who, before dying,
dispatched to him spirits to confuse him, and his companion, Illusion, favours their
efforts. But his friend Reasoning shows him his error, and he drives them away. Peace
of heart reunites Theology and Discrimination; she tells of her mishaps with Cult
and Exegesis, Nyāya and Sāṁkhya, and reveals to Being that he is the Supreme Lord.
This, however, is too much for his intellect, but the difficulty is cleared away by
Judgement, which is the immediate supernatural child of the reunion of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>spouses. The appearance of Trust (<i><span class="corr" id="xd32e10173" title="Source: bḥakti">bhakti</span></i>) in Viṣṇu to applaud the result terminates the drama.
</p>
<p>No one can doubt the cleverness with which the strife of races of one stock in the
<i>Mahābhārata</i> and the plot and love interest of the usual Nāṭikā are combined, nor the ingenuity
of fitting in the Vedānta doctrine of the Absolute and the devotion of the Vaiṣṇava
creed. There is certainly some comedy in the exchange of views of Egoism and Falsity,
who are perfect examples of hypocrisy, and the scenes between Buddhism, Jainism, and
Somism are distinctly funny. None the less it would be idle to pretend that the play
has any dramatic force. Its chief merits are its effective and stately stanzas of
moral and philosophical content. Kṛṣṇamiçra is an able master of the Çārdūlavikrīḍita,
his favourite metre; he has also effective Vasantatilakas, and rhymed Prākrit stanzas.
</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇamiçra’s example has caused the production of numerous dramas of the same type,
but of much less value. The <i>Saṁkalpasūryodaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n253.1src" href="#n253.1">27</a> of Ven̄kaṭanātha of the fourteenth century is excessively dreary, but it is better
than the famous <i>Caitanyacandrodaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n253.2src" href="#n253.2">28</a> of Kavikarṇapūra, which is an account of Caitanya’s success, but which wholly fails
to convey any suggestion of his spiritual power. He turns out as a long-winded discourser
of a muddled theology, surrounded by obedient and unintelligent pupils. Two Çaiva
dramas are the <i>Vidyāpariṇayana</i><a class="noteRef" id="n253.3src" href="#n253.3">29</a> and <i>Jīvānandana</i><a class="noteRef" id="n253.4src" href="#n253.4">30</a> written at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century. They

<p>An example of a Jain allegory of comparatively early date is afforded by the <i>Moharājaparājaya</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n253.5src" href="#n253.5">31</a> the conquest of King Confusion, describing the conversion of the Caulukya king of
Gujarāt, Kumārapāla, to Jainism, his prohibition of the killing of animals, and his
cessation from the practice of confiscating the property of persons dying without
heirs in the realm, as a result of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>efforts of the famous sage, Hemacandra. The author, Yaçaḥpāla, was the son of a minister
Dhanadeva and Rukmiṇī, of the Moḍha Bania caste, and he served the Cakravartin Abhayadeva
or Abhayapāla, who reigned after Kumārapāla from <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1229–32. The play is in five Acts, and all the personages save the king, Hemacandra,
and the Vidūṣaka, are personifications of qualities, good and evil. The play was performed
on the occasion of the festival of the idol of Mahāvira at the Kumāravihāra, or temple
erected by Kumārapāla, at Thārāpadra, where the author seems to have been governor
or resident.
</p>
<p>The play begins with an invocation in three stanzas of the Tīrthakaras, Ṛṣabha, Pārçva,
and Mahāvīra, followed by the usual dialogue of the Sūtradhāra and the actress, his
wife. Then are introduced Kumārapāla with the Vidūṣaka, to whom enter Jñānadarpaṇa,
the Mirror of Knowledge, the spy who has been sent to report on the affairs of King
Confusion. He reports the successful siege by Confusion of the city of Man’s Mind,
whose king, Vivekacandra, the Moon of Discrimination, has been forced to flee accompanied
by his bride Calm, and his daughter Kṛpāsundarī, in whom Compassion is incorporated,
and of whose escape Kumārapāla learns with joy. The spy further reports a meeting
with Kīrtimañjarī, the Garland of Fame, daughter of Good Conduct by his wife Polity,
and herself wife of Kumārapāla. She complains that the king has turned from her and
her brother, Pratāpa, Valour, owing to the efforts of a Jain monk. She has, therefore,
sought the aid of Confusion and he is preparing to attack Kumārapāla. The spy, however,
disappoints her by answering her inquiry as to the victory in the struggle by insisting
that it will be Confusion that must fall. The king expresses his determination to
overthrow Confusion, and the announcement of the hour of worship by bards terminates
the Act.
</p>
<p>An entr’acte then tells us through Puṇyaketu, the Banner of Merit, minister of the
king, that Discrimination has arrived at the penance grove of Hemacandra, and has
met the king, who has looked favourably at his daughter. The Act itself shows us in
the accustomed mode the king with the jester spying on Kṛpāsundarī and Somatā, Gentleness,<a class="noteRef" id="n254.1src" href="#n254.1">32</a> her companion, and ultimately <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>speaking to them; as usual the queen, Rājyaçrī, the Royal Fortune, with her companion,
Raudratā, Harshness, intervenes, and the king vainly craves pardon. In Act III Puṇyaketu
overcomes the obstacle to the match by a clever device; he stations one of his servants
behind the image of the goddess to which the queen goes to seek the boon of the disfigurement
of her rival, and thus, through apparent divine intervention, the queen is taught
that by marriage with Kṛpāsundarī alone can the king overcome Confusion, and is induced
to beg Discrimination for the hand of his daughter. Discrimination consents, but insists
that to please his daughter the seven vices must be banished, and the practice of
confiscating the property of those dying without heirs shall be abolished, terms to
which the queen consents. The king also agrees, and the Act ends in his action in
forgoing the property of a millionaire believed dead, who, however, opportunely turns
up with a new bride in an aerial car.
</p>
<p>In Act IV we have the fulfilment of the pledge to banish the seven vices. It first
tells of the meeting of the Fortune of the City with that of the Country; the former
persuades the latter to accept the tenets of Jainism. Then appears Kṛpāsundarī who
is annoyed by the noises of hunting and fishing, but consoled by the appearance of
the police officer, who proceeds to the business of banishing vices. Gambling, Flesh-eating,
Drinking, Slaughter, Theft, and Adultery must depart, despite the plea that the king’s
predecessors permitted them, and that they bring revenues to the State; Concubinage
may remain if she will. In Act V the king, armed by Hemacandra with his <i>Yogaçāstra</i>, which is his armour, and the <i>Vītarāgastuti</i>, which serves to make him invisible, inspects the strong places of Confusion, and
finally rendering himself visible does battle with the adversary and wins a great
victory. He restores Discrimination to his capital, and pronounces a benediction in
which praise of the Jina and of Hemacandra blend with the desire of close union with
Kṛpā and Discrimination, and the hope that ‘my fame, allied with the moon, may prevail
to dispel the darkness of Confusion’.
</p>
<p>The play is certainly not without merits; in the main it is written in simple Sanskrit,
free from the artifices which disfigure more pretentious plays, and it has also the
merit of bringing vividly before us the activities of Jainism in its regulation of
<span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>Kumārapāla’s kingdom, casting an interesting light on what is known from inscriptions
and other sources of the history of Gujarāt. The marriage of the king with Kṛpāsundarī
is recorded by Jinamaṇḍana in his <i>Kumārapālaprabandha</i> as taking place in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1159. Interesting details are given of the forms of gambling, including chess, and
of the sects which approve slaughter. The Prākrits are, of course, deeply influenced
by Hemacandra’s grammar, and include Māgadhī and Jain Māhārāṣṭrī.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>The Nāṭikā and the Saṭṭaka</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Nāṭikā differs in no real essential from a Nāṭaka save in the number of Acts,
but its type continues to be rigidly restricted to that set by Harṣa. The <i>Karṇasundarī</i><a class="noteRef" id="n256.1src" href="#n256.1">33</a> of Bilhaṇa belongs to the period about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1080–90. It seems to have been written out of compliment to Karṇadeva Trailokyamalla
of Aṇhilvāḍ (1064–94), and to celebrate his wedding in advanced age with Miyāṇalladevī,
daughter of the Karṇāṭa king, Jayakeçin. The story runs that the Cālukya king is to
marry Karṇasundarī, daughter of the Vidyādhara king. The minister introduces her into
the harem, and the king first sees her in a dream, then in a picture. He falls in
love, and the queen is jealous; she breaks in on their meeting, and once assumes Karṇasundarī’s
guise to present herself to the king. Next she tries to marry the king to a boy in
Karṇasundarī’s clothes, but the minister adroitly substitutes the real for the feigned
damsel, and the usual tidings of triumph abroad ends the play, which is a patent jumble
of reminiscences of Kālidāsa, Harṣa, and Rājaçekhara.
</p>
<p>Madana Bālasarasvatī, preceptor of the Paramāra Arjunavarman of Dhārā, wrote the <i>Vijayaçrī</i> or <i>Pārijātamañjarī</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n256.2src" href="#n256.2">34</a> a Nāṭikā in four Acts, of which two are preserved on stone at Dhārā. A garland falls
on the breast of Arjunavarman after his victory over the Cālukya king, Bhīmadeva II,
and becomes a maiden, who is handed over to the charge of the Chamberlain. She is
the daughter of the Cālukya, and the usual sequence of events leads to her wedlock
with the king. There is doubtless a historical reference; the date of the play is
early in the thirteenth century.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p>Rather less commonplace is Mathurādāsa’s effort in the <i>Vṛṣabhānujā</i><a class="noteRef" id="n257.1src" href="#n257.1">35</a> to make a Nāṭikā of the love of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā. He was a Kāyastha of Suvarṇaçekhara
on the Ganges and Yamunā, and he uses the motive of the jealousy of Rādhā for a portrait
of a lady which Kṛṣṇa has, but which turns out to be one of herself. A philosophic
play is Narasiṅha’s <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e10285" title="Source: Çivanārāyanabhañjamahodaya">Çivanārāyaṇabhañjamahodaya</span></i>, in honour of a prince of Keonjhor.
</p>
<p>The Saṭṭaka with its demand for Prākrit was too exacting for the average poet; we
have only the <i>Ānandasundarī</i><a class="noteRef" id="n257.2src" href="#n257.2">36</a> of the tedious Ghanaçyāma, minister of the Marāṭha Tukkojī and the <i>Çṛn̄gāramañjarī</i><a class="noteRef" id="n257.3src" href="#n257.3">37</a> of the Almora poet Viçveçvara of the eighteenth century.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The example of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> induced few imitations, doubtless because would-be imitators had the sense to realize
the appalling difficulties of producing anything worthy of setting beside that masterpiece.
There is, however, a servile redaction of the same idea as that of the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e10315" title="Source: Mālatimādhava">Mālatīmādhava</span></i> of Bhavabhūti in the <i>Mallikāmāruta</i><a class="noteRef" id="n257.4src" href="#n257.4">38</a> of Uddaṇḍin or Uddaṇḍanātha, who has had the quite undeserved honour of being taken
for Daṇḍin, but who was really no more than the court poet of the Zemindar of Kukkuṭakroḍa
or Calicut in the middle of the seventeenth century. The plot follows that of Bhavabhūti’s
play almost slavishly. The magician Mandākinī is eager to arrange a marriage between
Mallikā, daughter of the minister of the Vidyādhara king and Māruta, son of the minister
of the king of Kuntala. She arranges an interview between the two, who fall in love,
but the match is disturbed by the desire of the king of Ceylon for Mallikā’s hand.
Māruta’s friend Kalakaṇṭha is also in love with Ramayantikā. In Act III there is the
usual temple scene, and a couple of elephants are let loose to frighten the two maidens
and cause two rescues. Then Māruta is told by an emissary of the king of Ceylon that
Kalakaṇṭha is dead, and is only saved from suicide by his friend’s appearance. In
<span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>Act V Māruta tries conjuring up spirits; he finds Mallikā stolen by a Rākṣasa, rescues
her, but is himself stolen, and finally overcomes the demon. But the marriage is to
proceed, so that we have the elopement of Māruta and Mallikā, and the usual deception
of the bridegroom, while the other couple follow the example set and elope also. The
inevitable second abduction of Mallikā takes place, with the necessary search for
her, which at last is rewarded; all are united under Mandākinī’s protection, and the
king and the parents accord their sanction.
</p>
<p>The work is metrically interesting, because the author shows a remarkable preference
for the Vasantatilaka (118), and, while he is fond of the Çārdūlavikrīḍita and employs
a great variety of metres, he, unlike most later authors, uses freely the Āryā in
its different forms (74).
</p>
<p>We know also of Prakaraṇas written by Jain writers.<a class="noteRef" id="n258.1src" href="#n258.1">39</a> Rāmacandra, pupil of the great Hemacandra, who perished under the reign of Ajayapāla,
nephew and successor of Hemacandra’s patron, Kumārapāla, between <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1173 and 1176, wrote, besides other plays, the <i>Kaumudīmitrāṇanda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n258.2src" href="#n258.2">40</a> in ten Acts. The work is wholly undramatic and is really the working up in the form
of a play of a number of Kathā incidents, presenting a result not unlike the plot
of a modern pantomime. We first learn of a merchant’s son, Mitrāṇanda, who on the
island of Varuṇa attains as wife the daughter, Kaumudī, of the head of a monastery,
after he and his friend have freed from durance the Siddha king, cruelly nailed to
a tree by Varuṇa. She reveals to him the fact that the ascetics are frauds, and that
the fate of her husbands is normally to be flung into a pit under the nuptial chamber;
in this case, however, attracted to her husband by the love charm he had received
from Varuṇa, she agrees to flee with him and the treasure collected from former spouses
to Ceylon. There the pair would have been in evil plight, since Mitrāṇanda is taken
for a thief by the police, had he not cured from death by snake-bite the crown prince
Lakṣmīpati with the aid of the magic spell given to him to revive the dead by the
goddess Jān̄gulī on the occasion of his marriage. The king in gratitude entrusts the
pair to the minister, who, however, is enamoured of Kaumudī and anxious to get rid
of her husband. The opportunity is given <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>by a human sacrifice which a vassal of the king wishes to offer; Mitrāṇanda is sent
by the minister with a letter intended to secure his being the victim, but luckily
is recognized by Maitreya, his companion, who had won the vassal’s favour by curing
him by a magic herb. Kaumudī in the meantime is expelled from the minister’s house
by his jealous wife, and wanders until she meets Sumitrā, daughter of a merchant,
and her family; all are captured by a prince of the aborigines Vajravarman, to whom
also is brought one Makaranda, who turns out to be a friend of Mitrāṇanda. A letter
from Lakṣmīpati arrives to ask for the welfare of Mitrāṇanda and Kaumudī, and the
latter takes advantage of it to induce Vajravarman to celebrate the marriage of Makaranda
and Sumitrā. The three then have an adventure at Ekacakrā with a Kāpālika, who induces
the women to go into a subterranean cave, while he asks Mitrāṇanda’s aid against a
Vidyādhara, described as eager after women. He breathes life into a corpse which takes
a sword in its hand, but Mitrāṇanda by a magic formula induces it to strike the Kāpālika,
who disappears. In Act IX Makaranda has to establish before Lakṣmīpati his claim to
his own caravan, which a certain Naradatta claims; the dispute is settled by the appearance
of Vajravarman and Mitrāṇanda, while Act X disposes of the piece by uniting husband
and wife in the abode of the Siddha king. The work is, of course, wholly without interest
other than that presented by so many marvels appealing to the sentiment of wonder
in the audience. The author refers to Murāri in such a way as to suggest to Dr. Hultzsch<a class="noteRef" id="n259.1src" href="#n259.1">41</a> his contemporaneity with him, but this <span class="corr" id="xd32e10343" title="Not in source">is </span>in no wise rendered necessary by the wording of the passage cited, and, secondly,
would very badly agree with the fact that Man̄kha knew and cites Murāri about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1135, for it takes some time for an author to reach the stage of being treated as
an authority.
</p>
<p>Another Jaina composition is the <i>Prabuddharauhiṇeya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n259.2src" href="#n259.2">42</a> of one Rāmabhadra Muni, pupil of Jayaprabha Sūri, of the school of Deva Sūri, the
famous writer on Nyāya, who died in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1169. It was written for performance in a temple of Yugādideva, that is the Tīrthakara
Ṛṣabha, on the occasion of a procession <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>festival. It is in six Acts. In Act I Rauhiṇeya, who is a bold bandit, steals away
Madanavatī, a married woman, while his helper, a Çabara, who speaks Māgadhī, keeps
her lover at bay. In the next Act he dresses up as the mother of a youth Manoratha,
and abducts him for the sake of his ornaments, terrifying the bystanders with a snake
made out of rags. The next three Acts tell of the complaints of these robberies made
to Çreṇika of Magadha, and the efforts of his minister Abhayakumāra to find the guilty
man, ending ultimately in the arrest of the robber, who, however, stoutly maintains
his innocence, though he fails in succeeding in winning his discharge. In Act VI women
and musicians under the control of Bharata, a teacher of dancing, endeavour to deceive
him into the belief that he is in heaven, and thus to win a confession of his misdeeds
from him. But he sees through the play, for he remembers a verse which he had heard
spoken by Vardhamāna Svāmin before his captivity, in which the characteristics<a class="noteRef" id="n260.1src" href="#n260.1">43</a> of the gods, freedom from perspiration, unfaded garlands, and feet that do not touch
the ground, were set out. The miscreant thus is pronounced innocent, but, liberated,
manifests his penitence by taking the king and the minister to the mount Vaibhāra,
in which are the treasures he has stolen and the missing boy and woman. The topic
is one handled by Hemacandra in the matter illustrating his <i>Yogaçāstra</i>.
</p>
<p>Quite different is the character of the <i>Mudritakumudacandra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n260.2src" href="#n260.2">44</a> of Yaçaçcandra, son of Padmacandra, grandson of Dhanadeva of the Dharkaṭa family,
who was, it seems, the minister of a prince of Çākambharī in Sapādalakṣa. The play
describes the controversy which took place in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1124 between the Çvetāmbara Jaina teacher Deva Sūri, mentioned above, and the Digambara
Kumudacandra, in which the latter was silenced, whence the title of the piece.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">6.</span> <i>The Prahasana and the Bhāṇa</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Popular as the Prahasana or farce must have been, we have in this period no example
preserved certainly older than the <i>Laṭakamelaka</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n260.3src" href="#n260.3">45</a> written in the earlier part of the twelfth century under Govindacandra of Kanyakubja
by Çan̄khadhara Kavirāja. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>nature of the play is characteristic; the action passes at the house of the go-between
Danturā, to which come all sorts of people anxious to buy the affection of the fascinating
Madanamañjarī. Comic relief is further provided by the arrival of doctor Jantuketu
to extract a fish-bone from the damsel’s throat. He is perfectly incompetent and his
methods absurd, but they affect their purpose indirectly, since, through laughing
at his antics, the bone is happily dislodged. The bargaining of the lovers is satirized,
and the marriage which is actually arranged is one between the go-between herself
and a Digambara, a type doubtless sure to raise a laugh.
</p>
<p>Of much later date is the well-known <i>Dhūrtasamāgama</i><a class="noteRef" id="n261.1src" href="#n261.1">46</a> of Jyotirīçvara Kaviçekhara, son of Dhaneçvara, grandson of Rāmeçvara, of the family
of Dhīreçvara who wrote under the Vijayanagara king Narasiṅha (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1487–1507), though a Nepalese manuscript makes his father Dhīrasiṅha and his patron
Harasiṅha, who has been identified, implausibly, with Harisiṅha of Simraon (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1324). The first part of the play relates the contest of the religious mendicant
Viçvanagara and his pupil Durācāra, whose names are significant, over the beautiful
Anan̄gasenā; the pupil has every reason to complain, since it was he who saw the fair
one and confided his love to his master, who meanly seeks to secure the damsel’s favour
in lieu. She insists on the matter being referred to arbitration, and in the second
part the Brahmin Asajjāti, Impure Race, an expert at dealing with delicate matters
of casuistry, undertakes the duty, and wisely decides to impound the damsel for himself,
though, while he is deliberating, his Vidūṣaka seeks to secure the prize for himself.
The case over, the barber Mūlanāçaka, Root Destroyer, turns up to demand payment of
a debt from Anan̄gasenā. She refers him to Asajjāti, who pays him with his pupil’s
purse; he then demands the barber’s care; the latter ties him up and leaves him to
be rescued by the Vidūṣaka.
</p>
<p>Very popular is Jagadīçvara’s <i>Hāsyārṇava</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n261.2src" href="#n261.2">47</a> The king, Anayasindhu, Ocean of Misrule, is devastated because all goes ill in his
realm: Caṇḍālas make shoes, not Brahmins, wives are chaste, husbands constant, and
the good respected. He asks his minister where best he can study the character of
his people, and is <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>advised to go to the house of the go-between, Bandhurā, who presents to him her daughter,
Mṛgān̄kalekhā. The court <span class="corr" id="xd32e10420" title="Source: chaplin">chaplain</span> enters with his pupil, and <span class="corr" id="xd32e10423" title="Not in source">they </span>are attracted to the damsel. A comic doctor is called in for Bandhurā, who feels ill;
his remedies are worse than the disease, and he has to run away. A series of other
figures are introduced. Then a barber, who has cut a patient; the latter demands damages,
but is non-suited; then comes the chief of police, Sādhuhiṅsika, Terror to the Good,
the comic general Raṇajambuka, the astrologer Mahāyātrika, who indicates as the time
for a journey the conjunction of stars presaging death. The king disappears at the
end of the first Act; the second deals with the efforts of the chaplain and his pupil
to obtain the damsel; but rivals come in the form of another man of religion and his
pupil; finally the two older reprobates secure the damsel, while the boys content
themselves with Bandhurā, who is delighted with the turn of events. But the celebration
of these double marriages is left to another holy man, Mahānindaka, who also desires
to share the hetaera. The date of the piece is unknown, as is that of the <i>Kautukasarvasva</i><a class="noteRef" id="n262.1src" href="#n262.1">48</a> of Gopīnātha Cakravartin, written for the autumn festival of the Durgāpūjā in Bengal.
It is more amusing and less vulgar than most of these pieces; the king, Kalivatsala,
who is licentious, addicted to every kind of vice, and a lover of hemp juice, ill-treats
the virtuous Brahmin Satyācāra, who finds that everything is wrong in the state, even
the people being valiant in oppression, skilled in falsehood, and persevering only
in contempt for the pious. The general is valiant: he can cleave a roll of butter
with his blade, and trembles at the approach of a mosquito. Play is made with the
immoralities recounted in the Purāṇas; the objections of the Ṛṣis to vice are put
down to the fact that they censured in others what they themselves were too old to
enjoy. The king proclaims free love, but becomes himself involved in a dispute over
a hetaera. He is summoned back to the queen, which so annoys the hetaera that every
one hastens to console her, and the king, obligingly to please her, banishes all Brahmins
from the realm.
</p>
<p>The <i>Dhūrtanartaka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n262.2src" href="#n262.2">49</a> of Sāmarāja Dīkṣita is of the seventeenth century. It deals with one Mureçvara, who,
though a Çaiva ascetic, is a devotee of a dancing girl whom he entrusts to his <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>pupils on having to go away. They seek to secure the favours of the damsel and, failing
in this, denounce him to the king, but Pāpācāra, Bad Conduct, is merely amused and
allows the saint to keep the damsel. Rather earlier is the <i>Kautukaratnākara</i><a class="noteRef" id="n263.1src" href="#n263.1">50</a> by the chaplain of Lakṣmaṇa Māṇikyadeva of Bhūluyā, which centres in the carrying
off of the queen, though the chief of police sleeps beside her to guard her, and the
adventures of the hetaera who is to take her place at the spring festival.
</p>
<p>The Bhāṇa, despite its antiquity, attested by the theory, is not represented early
in the history of the drama. To Vāmana Bhaṭṭa Bāṇa, about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1500, we owe the <i>Çṛn̄gārabhūṣaṇa</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n263.2src" href="#n263.2">51</a> which is typical of the class. The chief Viṭa, Vilāsaçekhara, comes out to pay a
visit to the hetaera Anan̄gamañjarī on the evening of the spring festival. He goes
into the street of the hetaerae, and takes part in a series of imaginary conversations,
giving the answers himself to his own questions, or pretending to listen to some one
out of sight and then repeating the answers. He describes the hetaerae, ram-fights,
cock-fights, boxing, a quarrel between two rivals, the different stages of the day,
and the pleasures of the festival. Much on the same lines is the <i>Çṛn̄gāratilaka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n263.3src" href="#n263.3">52</a> or <i>Ayyābhāṇa</i> of Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita, which was written to rival the <i>Vasantatilaka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n263.4src" href="#n263.4">53</a> or <i>Ammābhāṇa</i> of Varadācārya or Ammāl Ācārya, the Vaiṣṇava. The play was written for performance
at the festival of the marriage of Mīnākṣī, the deity of Madurā. Bhujan̄gaçekhara,
the hero, is vexed at the departure of his beloved Hemān̄gī, but is assured of meeting
her again, despite her return to her husband. He makes the usual promenade in the
hetaerae’s street, has the usual imaginary conversations and describes the ordinary
sights, including snake charmers and magic shows of gods and their mountains and so
forth. Finally he succeeds in rejoining Hemān̄gī. We have similar lengthy descriptions
in the <i>Çāradātilaka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n263.5src" href="#n263.5">54</a> of Çan̄kara, who places the scene in the feigned city of uproar, Kolāhalapura, and
whose satire extends to the Jan̄gamas or Çaivas and the Vaiṣṇavas. Nallā Kavi (<i>c.</i> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1700) is responsible for the <i>Çṛn̄gārasarvasva</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n263.6src" href="#n263.6">55</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>which deals with Anan̄gaçekhara, who has to part from his beloved Kanakalatā, but
he is helped to meet her by the advent of an elephant which terrifies all the others
in the street, but is worshipped by the lover as Gaṇeça and Çiva’s answer to his prayer
for help. A slight variant is presented by the <i>Rasasadana</i><a class="noteRef" id="n264.1src" href="#n264.1">56</a> by a Yuvarāja from Koṭilin̄ga in Kerala; the hero here is a chief Viṭa who has promised
his friend Mandāraka to look after his loved one for him. He goes about with her to
a temple, and then to his house; wanders out into the street, talks and describes
at large, and finally, after accepting the invitation of a lady from a neighbouring
town to pay her a visit, goes back home to find the lovers united again.
</p>
<p>The Prahasanas and Bhāṇas are hopelessly coarse from any modern Europe standpoint,
but they are certainly often in a sense artistic productions. The writers have not
the slightest desire to be simple; in the Prahasana their tendency to run riot is
checked, as verse is confined to erotic stanzas and descriptions, and some action
exists. In the Bhāṇa, on the other hand, the right to describe is paramount, and the
poets give themselves full rein. They exhibit in this comic monologue precisely the
same defects as are seen in the contemporary Nāṭaka; all is reduced to a study of
stylistic effects, especially as regards sound. They rejoice in exhibiting their large
command of the Sanskrit vocabulary, as obtained from the lexica, and the last thing
desired is simplicity or perspicuity. Nothing more clearly indicates the close connexion
of the two styles than the fact that we find a type of mixed Bhāṇa in the <i>Mukundānanda</i><a class="noteRef" id="n264.2src" href="#n264.2">57</a> of Kāçīpati Kavirāja, who is certainly not earlier than the thirteenth century. The
adventures recounted by Bhujan̄gaçekhara, the hero, allude also to the sports of Kṛṣṇa
and the cowherdesses, a double allusion which explains the difficulty of the style
asserted by the author.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Vyāyoga seems not to have been often written, despite the example of Bhāsa. The
<i>Pārthaparākrama</i><a class="noteRef" id="n264.3src" href="#n264.3">58</a> of Prahlādanadeva falls in the period between <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1163 and half a century <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>later, for its author was the brother of Dhārāvarṣa, son of Yaçodhavala, and lord
of Candrāvatī, whose reign ranks honourably in the records of the Paramāras of Mount
Ābu. It was acted on the occasion of the festival of the investment of Acaleçvara,
the tutelary deity of Mount Ābu with the sacred thread, and claims to exhibit the
sentiment of excitement (<i>dīptarasa</i>). The story, taken from the Virāṭa Parvan of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, is the well-known one of the recovery by Arjuna of the cows of Virāṭa, raided by
the Kauravas, and the defeat of the raiders. It accords, therefore, well with the
definition in the text-books, for the struggle which it describes is not caused by
a woman, the feminine interest is restricted to the colourless figures of Draupadī
and Uttarā, and the hero is neither a divine being nor a king. The poet, whose fame
as a warrior and whose princely generosity are extolled by Someçvara, claims for his
poetry the merits of smooth composition and clearness, and these may be admitted,
though the play does not rise above mediocrity. Technically the play is of some interest,
in so far as after the Nāndī the Sthāpaka enters, recites a couple of stanzas, and
then an actor comes on the stage who addresses him, but is answered by the Sūtradhāra;
apparently the two terms were here synonymous to the author of the play or the later
tradition. Moreover the final benediction is allotted, not to Arjuna, the hero of
the play, but to Vāsava, who appears at the close of the play in a celestial chariot
in company with the Apsarases to bestow applause and blessing. Prahlādana wrote other
works, of which some verses are preserved in the anthologies, and must have been a
man of considerable ability and merit.
</p>
<p>The <i>Kirātārjunīya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n265.1src" href="#n265.1">59</a> is a Vyāyoga based on Bhāravi’s epic by Vatsarāja, who calls himself the minister
of Paramardideva of Kālañjara, who reigned from <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1163 to 1203. Vatsarāja is interesting as a good specimen of the poet of decadence;
we have from him six plays illustrating each a different type of drama. The <i>Karpūracaritra</i> is a Bhāṇa of orthodox type; the gambler Karpūraka describes in monologue his revelry,
gambling, and love. The <i>Hāsyacūḍāmaṇi</i> is a farce in one act which has as its hero an Ācārya of the Bhāgavata school, styled
Jñānarāçi, who professes the possession of supernatural knowledge, <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>enabling him to trace lost articles and buried treasure, and who carries out his professions
by various tricks and fooleries. He has an irresistible pupil, who is sadly lacking
in respect for his teacher, and delights in interpreting literally his remarks. The
<i>Kirātārjunīya</i> has no special merit, but is technically interesting; after a Nāndī celebrating Çiva’s
consort, the Sūtradhāra enters, immediately followed by the Sthāpaka, who insists
on his reciting a further Nāndī of the trident of Çiva, on the score that the play
is heroic in sentiment and should be appropriately introduced. This play was produced
later than the other five, for it came out under Trailokyavarmadeva, successor of
Paramardi. The other three plays, an Īhāmṛga, Ḍima, and Samavakāra will be noticed
below.
</p>
<p>We have also a Vyāyoga by Viçvanātha, the <i>Saugandhikāharaṇa</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n266.1src" href="#n266.1">60</a> of about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1316, which deals with Bhīma’s visit to Kubera’s lake to fetch water-lilies for Draupadī,
his struggle first with Hanumant and then with the Yakṣas, and his final victory;
the Pāṇḍavas meet at Kubera’s home and Draupadī obtains her desired flowers. Of unknown
date is the <i>Dhanaṁjayavijaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n266.2src" href="#n266.2">61</a> of Kāñcana Paṇḍita, son of Nārāyaṇa, which deals with the prowess of Arjuna in the
defeat of Duryodhana and the Kauravas when they raid the cattle of Virāṭa, evidently
a special favourite of the dramatic authors. The description of the contest in which
Arjuna uses magic weapons is given by Indra and a couple of his celestial entourage;
the play ends with the giving to Arjuna’s son Uttarā, daughter of the king Virāṭa,
in marriage. A manuscript of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1328 is extant of the <i>Bhīmavikramavyāyoga</i><a class="noteRef" id="n266.3src" href="#n266.3">62</a> of Mokṣāditya, while the <i>Nirbhayabhīma</i><a class="noteRef" id="n266.4src" href="#n266.4">63</a> of Rāmacandra belongs to the second half of the twelfth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>
</p>
<p>Of the type Īhāmṛga we have a specimen by Vatsarāja in the <i>Rukmiṇīharaṇa</i>, which in four Acts deals with the success of Kṛṣṇa in depriving Çiçupāla of Cedi
of Rukmiṇī, his promised bride. The play opens with a dialogue between the Sūtradhāra
who enters, after a Nāndī in a couple of stanzas has been pronounced, and the Sthāpaka,
which tells us that the play was performed at moonrise during the festival of Cakrasvāmin.
The action of the play is languid, and the author has had trouble to <span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>spread it out over four Acts; the characters are conventional; Rukmiṇī the heroine
is a nonentity, and neither Çiçupāla nor Rukmin, the objects of Kṛṣṇa’s enmity, has
any distinct characterization. Kṛṣṇa goes into a state of trance on the stage in Act
IV to produce the presence of Tārkṣya to enable him to complete his victory. The female
character, Subuddhi, uses Sanskrit in lieu of Prākrit.
</p>
<p>Other dramas of this type<a class="noteRef" id="n267.1src" href="#n267.1">64</a> are the late <i>Vīravijaya</i> of Kṛṣṇamiçra, and the <i>Sarvavinodanāṭaka</i> of Kṛṣṇa Avadhūta Ghaṭikāçata Mahākavi.
</p>
<p>To Vatsarāja also we owe a specimen of the Ḍima, the <i>Tripuradāha</i> in four Acts, which describes the destruction of the capital of Tripurāsura by Çiva.
The idea of writing such a piece was doubtless given by the mention of a work of this
name in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, and the play is extremely insipid; the numerous figures who crowd the stage are
lifeless, and the celestial weapons which overcome the Asuras lack reality; the convenances
are duly observed; Kumāra in the full flight of his triumph is stayed by his father’s
commands, and Çukra delightedly records this act of courtesy on the part of the god,
despite his anger with the Dānavas. The play closes with the homage paid by the gods
and the seers alike to Maheça, who is bashful, and the benediction is pronounced by
Indra, not by the hero of the drama.
</p>
<p>Other Ḍimas are late; thus we have one by the ubiquitous Ghanaçyāma, the <i>Kṛṣṇavijaya</i> of Ven̄kaṭavarada, and the <i>Manmathonmathana</i><a class="noteRef" id="n267.2src" href="#n267.2">65</a> of Rāma, a drama of 1820.
</p>
<p>Vatsarāja is also responsible for a Samavakāra, the <i>Samudramathana</i>, in three Acts, which again owes its existence doubtless to the naming of a work
with a kindred title in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> as the model of a Samavakāra. Here again we find after a Nāndī of two stanzas the
Sūtradhāra and the Sthāpaka engaged in conversation. The former and his eleven brothers
seek simultaneously to attain wealth; how is this possible? The Sthāpaka suggests
either homage to Paramardi or to the ocean, a statement duly caught up by a voice
behind the stage, which asserts that from the ocean comes the fulfilment of wishes,
followed by the entry of Padmaka. The play is based on the legend of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>churning of the ocean by the gods and demons with its sequel, the winning by Viṣṇu
of Lakṣmī and the gaining of other desired objects by the participators in the enterprise.
The treatment fails to rise above the commonplace; Lakṣmī appears in Act I with Lajjā
and Dhṛti, her companions, in the normal occupation of gazing on a picture of her
beloved, who later appears also on the scene. The artificiality of the type is proved
by the absence of other dramas of this kind.
</p>
<p>The An̄ka, or one-Act play, is represented by very few specimens. The term is often
applied to denote a play within a play, in the <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> the name Prekṣaṇaka is applied generally to such plays. The same name is also given
to the <i>Unmattarāghava</i><a class="noteRef" id="n268.1src" href="#n268.1">66</a> of Bhāskara Kavi, of unknown date, though the Vidyāraṇya mentioned in it may be Sāyaṇa
or his contemporary. The play is a stupid imitation of Act IV of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>; while Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa pursue the golden gazelle, Sītā, by the curse of Durvāsas,
is changed into a gazelle herself; Rāma returns and wanders miserably in search of
her, but finally wins her by the help of Agastya.
</p>
<p>The term Prekṣaṇaka is also applied to the <i>Kṛṣṇābhyudaya</i> of Lokanātha Bhaṭṭa, written for the raintime procession of the Lord of Hastigiri,
Viṣṇu, in Kāñcī. A number of modern plays, which may be styled An̄kas, are also known,
while the <i>Çarmiṣṭhāyayāti</i> in the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i> may be identical with the work of that name by Kṛṣṇa Kavi.<a class="noteRef" id="n268.2src" href="#n268.2">67</a>
</p>
<p>Of the types of Uparūpaka, other than the Nāṭikā and Saṭṭaka, there are very few represented,
and these only obviously written in accord with the text-book definitions. Thus Rūpa
Gosvāmin has left a Bhāṇikā, the <i>Dānakelikaumudī</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n268.3src" href="#n268.3">68</a> among his varied efforts to adapt the drama to the tenets of his faith, and the <i>Subhadrāharaṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n268.4src" href="#n268.4">69</a> of Mādhava, son of the Maṇḍaleçvara Bhaṭṭa and Indumatī, and brother of Harihara,
styles itself a Çrīgadita. As it describes itself in terms similar to those used in
the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i>, it is quite possibly posterior to that work, and, on the other hand, there exists
a manuscript of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1610. The story of the play is the old legend of the elopement of Kṛṣṇa’s friend
Arjuna with Subhadrā, whom he meets <span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>by going to her father’s house as a beggar. The presence of a narrative verse has
suggested comparison with a shadow-drama, but for this there is inadequate evidence.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">8.</span> <i>The Shadow Play</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is extremely doubtful at what date the shadow-drama appeared in India; the first
play which we can be certain was represented in this way is the <i>Dharmābhyudaya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n269.1src" href="#n269.1">70</a> of Meghaprabhācārya, which in the stage direction mentions once clearly a puppet
(<i>putraka</i>) and calls itself a Chāyānāṭyaprabandha. Unluckily the age of this work does not
seem to be ascertainable with any certainty.
</p>
<p>It is natural to suggest, as did Pischel, that the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i> of Subhaṭa, which is styled a Chāyānāṭaka, really was a shadow play. On the other
hand, Rājendralālamitra<a class="noteRef" id="n269.2src" href="#n269.2">71</a> suggested that the drama was perhaps simply intended as an entr’acte, and this may
be justified on the interpretation of the term of drama in the form of a shadow: i.e.
reduced to the minimum for representation in such a form. The play itself unluckily
contains nothing to help us to a decision as to its real character. It was represented
in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1243 in honour of the dead king <span class="corr" id="xd32e10683" title="Source: Kumārapala">Kumārapāla</span> at the court of Tribhuvanapāla, a Caulukya of Aṇahilapāṭaka, and it has come down
to us in various forms. A longer and shorter recension may be distinguished, though
not very definitely; in the longer form occur epic verses, and an introduction is
prefixed in thirty-nine stanzas, partly placed in the mouths of Rāma and Hanumant,
describing the finding of Sītā’s hiding-place. The story is the simple one of An̄gada’s
mission as an ambassador to Rāvaṇa to demand back Sītā; Rāvaṇa endeavours to persuade
An̄gada that Sītā is in love with him. An̄gada is not deceived, and leaves Rāvaṇa
with threats, and we learn shortly afterwards that Rāvaṇa has met his doom. The merits
of the work are negligible.
</p>
<p>We have no other play of which we can say with even the slightest plausibility that
it was a real shadow-drama. There are three works by Vyāsa Çrīrāmadeva from the fifteenth
<span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>century, his patrons being Kalacuri princes of Raypur. The first, the <i>Subhadrāpariṇayana</i>, produced under Brahmadeva or Haribrahmadeva, deals with the threadworn topic of
the winning of <span class="corr" id="xd32e10692" title="Source: Arjuna’a">Arjuna’s</span> bride; the second, the <i>Rāmābhyudaya</i> appeared under the Mahārāṇa Meru, and deals with the conquest of Lan̄kā, the fire
ordeal of Sītā, and the return to Ayodhyā; the third, the <i>Pāṇḍavābhyudaya</i>, written under Raṇamalladeva, describes in two Acts Draupadī’s birth and marriage.
But that these were really shadow-dramas is not indicated by anything save the title,
for they resemble ordinary dramas in all other respects. The <i>Sāvitrīcarita</i> of Çan̄karalāla, son of Maheçvara, calls itself a Chāyānāṭaka, but the work, written
in 1882, is an ordinary drama, and Lüders<a class="noteRef" id="n270.1src" href="#n270.1">72</a> is doubtless right in recognizing that these are not shadow dramas at all. On the
other hand, he adds to the list the <i>Haridūta</i>, which tells the story given in the <i>Dūtavākya</i> of Bhāsa of the mission of Kṛṣṇa to the Pāṇḍavas’ enemies to seek to attain peace.
This drama, however, does not describe itself as a Chāyānāṭaka, and the argument is,
accordingly, without value. But what is most significant, there is no allusion to
this sort of drama in the theory which suggests that its introduction was decidedly
late.

<div id="ch11.9" class="div2 last-child section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd32e1033">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">9.</span> <i>Dramas of Irregular Type</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Professor Lüders<a class="noteRef" id="n270.2src" href="#n270.2">73</a> adds to the almost non-existing list of shadow dramas, the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i>. He does this on the strength of the fact that it is written mainly in verse, with
little of prose; that the verse is decidedly at times of the narrative as opposed
to the dramatic type; there is no Prākrit; the number of persons appearing is large,
and there is no Vidūṣaka, and these characteristics are found in the <i>Dūtān̄gada</i>, which is a Chāyānāṭaka in name. The argument is clearly inadequate in the absence
of any real evidence, and the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i> can be explained in other ways.
</p>
<p>The history of this play is curious. It is preserved in two recensions, one in nine
or ten Acts redacted by Madhusūdana and one in fourteen by Dāmodaramiçra. The stories
given by the commentator Mohanadāsa and the <i>Bhojaprabandha</i>, agree in effect that the play was put together by order of Bhoja from <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>fragments found on rocks, which were fished out of the sea; the tradition was that
Hanumant himself wrote the work, which, therefore, is called <i>Hanumannāṭaka</i>, but that to please Vālmīki, who recognized that it would eclipse his great epic,
the generous ape permitted his rival to cast into the sea the drama which he had inscribed
on the rocks. This certainly suggests that some old matter was embodied in the play,
and this view has been strengthened by the fact that Ānandavardhana cites three verses
out of the play, but without giving any source, as also do Rājaçekhara in the <i>Kāvyamīmāṅsā</i> and Dhanika in his <i>Daçarūpāvaloka</i>, so that the evidence is not of much worth, for the work, as we have it, plagiarizes
shamelessly from the dramas of Bhavabhūti, Murāri, and Rājaçekhara, and even from
Jayadeva’s <i>Prasannarāghava</i>, unless we are to suppose that in the latter case the borrowing is the other way.
The question which is the earlier of the two recensions is unsolved; the one with
fewer Acts has 730 as opposed to 581 verses, and of these about 300 are in common.<a class="noteRef" id="n271.1src" href="#n271.1">74</a>
</p>
<p>There is a brief benediction, but no prologue, and narrative follows down to the arrival
of Rāma at Mithilā for the winning of Sītā by breaking the bow of Çiva; this part
of the action is given in a dialogue between Sītā, Janaka, Rāma, and others. More
narrative leads up to a scene with Paraçurāma, then narrative follow to Sītā’s marriage.
Act II is undramatic, being a highly flavoured description of Sītā’s love passages
with Rāma. Act III again is mainly descriptive, carrying the story down to the departure
of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in chase of Mārīca in deer shape. Act IV carries the story down
to Rāma’s return to the deserted hut; in Act V Rāma seeks Sītā and sends Hanumant
to Lan̄kā; in the next Act Hanumant consoles Sītā and returns; in Act VII the host
of apes crosses the ocean; in Act VIII, which is much more dramatic than usual, we
have An̄gada’s mission to Rāvaṇa; and the rest of the Acts drag out the wearisome
details of the conflict, often in so imperfect a manner as to be unintelligible without
knowledge of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> and the earlier dramas. The two versions generally correspond, but not with any precision
in detail.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>The exact purpose of such a play is not obvious, but it looks rather like a literary
<i>tour de force</i>, possibly in preparation for some form of performance<a class="noteRef" id="n272.1src" href="#n272.1">75</a> at which the dialogue was plentifully eked out by narrative by the director and the
other actors. It is incredible, however, that, as we have it, it can ever have served
any practical end, and its chief value, such as it is, is to reflect possibly the
form of drama of a period when the drama had not yet completely emerged from the epic
condition. We should thus have the old work of the Granthikas reinforced by putting
part of the dialogue in the mouths of real actors. But it would be dangerous in so
late a production to lay any stress on the possibility of deriving hence evidence
for the growth of the early drama. It is, however, legitimate to note that there are
similarities between the type and that of the performance of a Tamil version of the
<i>Çakuntalā</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n272.2src" href="#n272.2">76</a> The curious number of Acts has been suggested as indicating that the original was
otherwise divided than a normal drama, but on this it would be dangerous to lay much
stress.
</p>
<p>The metre of the play exhibits the extraordinary fact of 253 Çārdūlavikrīḍita stanzas
to 109 Çloka, 83 Vasantatilaka, 77 Sragdharā, 59 Mālinī, and 55 Indravajrā type. This
fact, in the version of Madhusūdana, is sufficient to show how far we are removed
from anything primitive.
</p>
<p>The type of the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i> may be compared with the <i>Gītagovinda</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n272.3src" href="#n272.3">77</a> which, written by Jayadeva under Lakṣmaṇasena in the twelfth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, exhibits songs sung by Kṛṣṇa, Rādhā, and her companion, intermingled with lyric
stanzas of the poet, describing their position, or the emotions excited, and addressing
prayer to Kṛṣṇa. The work is a poem, and can be enjoyed simply as such, but it is
also capable of a quasi-dramatic presentment. It reveals a highly-developed outcome
of the simple Yātrās of the Kṛṣṇa religion.
</p>
<p>In the <i>Gopālakelicandrikā</i><a class="noteRef" id="n272.4src" href="#n272.4">78</a> of Rāmakṛṣṇa of Gujarāt, of unknown date, but certainly later than the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i> and the <i>Bhāgavata Purāṇa</i>, we have an irregular drama whose form has <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>excited a large number of conjectures, including the inevitable but absurd solution
of a shadow play. The nearest parallel of those suggested in this case and in that
of the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i><a class="noteRef" id="n273.1src" href="#n273.1">79</a> is the Swāng of North-West India, in that the actors recite the narrative parts as
well as take part in the dialogue. There seems no special reason to doubt that the
same thing might have taken place in this case, though it is conceivable that it was
an imitation of the type of entertainment in which a Brahmin says the spoken parts,
while his small pupils go through the action of the drama, possibly a far-off parallel
to the Çaubhikas as far as the action is concerned. But it is quite possibly no more
than a literary exercise, and the same judgement may apply to the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i>. The fact that both talk as if there were action is no sign of real representation.
The modern written drama is full of stage directions, though it may never succeed
in obtaining a performance on the stage, and we have not the slightest reason to deny
the existence of the literary drama in India.<a class="noteRef" id="n273.2src" href="#n273.2">80</a> The piece is highly stylized, and could only be understood, if at all, by a cultivated
audience.
</p>
<p>The connexion of the play with the <i>Hanumannāṭaka</i> is expressly admitted in the prologue; the actress, who enters with the usual inquiry
in Prākrit as to the business to be undertaken, is informed by the Sūtradhāra that
this is not a case for Prākrit, but for Sanskrit, alone worthy of an audience of Viṣṇu
devotees. The actress, not unnaturally, asks how a drama is possible without Prākrit,
to be comforted by the parallel of the <i>Hanumannāṭaka</i>. This seems a clear enough indication that the work is a literary exercise rather
than a genuine stage play representing a living form of dramatic representation. From
an ordinary play it is distinguished by the fact that we have stanzas and prose of
merely narrative character, and we learn from one passage that these parts are directed
by the Sūcaka to the spectator. The Sūcaka may be equated, on the authority of Hemacandra,
with the Sūtradhāra, and if we assume that the play was actually <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>performed,<a class="noteRef" id="n274.1src" href="#n274.1">81</a> all we need do is to assume that the director thus intervened from time to time to
help on the action of the play. We are, in any case, very far from the primitive drama,
as the long compounds of the prose show, reminding us of the worst eccentricities
of Bhavabhūti.
</p>
<p>The work begins with an act of religious devotion, the performance of the ceremony
of the waving of a lamp in honour of Kṛṣṇa, who appears in the vesture of a herdsman,
and thus receives in person the worship of his votaries. The play is essentially religious
and mystic, despite the fact that the sports of Kṛṣṇa and his comrades, and of Rādhā
and her friends, are duly introduced. In Act III we have from the mouth of Vṛndā,
that is Lakṣmī, a series of verses setting out the mystic doctrine of the identity
of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā; Kṛṣṇa is the highest being, descended to earth in the guise of
a herdsman, and Rādhā represents his Çakti. In Act IV we have the usual scene of the
theft by Kṛṣṇa of the clothes of the maidens when they bathe in the Yamunā, but the
restoration is made a test of their faith; Kṛṣṇa demands their devotion as the price
of their garments, and asserts that faith in him is superior to the Vedas, to asceticism,
and to sacrifice as a means of securing knowledge of him. In the last Act we find
the spirits of the night of full moon and of autumn lamenting that the maidens are
not dancing the Rāsa with Kṛṣṇa, who appears, and whom they remind of this duty of
his. He summons his magic power (<i>yogamāyā</i>) and bids her proceed to the station of the herders to summon the maidens to the
dance. Then it is narrated how he himself goes there, and with his flute draws out
the maidens to join him, while the gods come in multitudes to pay him honour. Many
verses from the <i>Bhāgavata Purāṇa</i> are here borrowed. Finally the god accepts the homage of the maidens and leads them
in the dance, as is described again in narrative, until the director breaks off the
piece with the assertion that it is impossible to represent adequately the greatness
of the god. We can see at once, even if we were not told, that the author was under
the influence of Rāmānuja, and the fact that his father bears the name of Devajī<a class="noteRef" id="n274.2src" href="#n274.2">82</a> suggests a decidedly modern date.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>A glimpse into a form of entertainment not represented by any Sanskrit drama so far
published is given by the changes made in the fourth Act of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> at an unknown date. The Apabhraṅça stanzas introduced into that Act cannot be assigned
to the period of Kālidāsa, unless we are to rewrite the history of the language; Apabhraṅça
represents not a vernacular but a definitely literary language in which the vocabulary
is based on Prākrit, and the inflexions on a vernacular with free use of Prākrit forms
as well. Guhasena of Valabhī, of whom we have inscriptions of <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 559–69, was celebrated as a composer in Apabhraṅça as well as in Sanskrit and Prākrit,
and the new literary form may have arisen in the sixth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> as an effort to produce something nearer the vernacular than Prākrit, but yet literary,
much as the modern dialects have evolved literatures largely by reliance on Sanskrit.
It can hardly be doubted that the Apabhraṅça stanzas represent the libretto of a pantomime
(<i>nṛtya</i>). Such pantomimes are well known as a form of the nautch at Rājput courts; the dancers
perform a well-known scene, and sing verses to a musical accompaniment; the chief
element, however, is the gestures and postures. In the case of the pantomime based
on the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, the verses placed in the mouth of the king may have been sung by an actor, while
those regarding the forsaken elephant and the Haṅsas may have been sung by singers,
male or female, acting under him. There is an introduction in Prākrit for the libretto,
which very possibly as inserted in the drama has not come down to us in full, though
in any case the libretto in such instances is of only secondary importance and never
adequate. It is a plausible suggestion that the introduction of the libretto into
the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> was the outcome of the difficulty felt by the ordinary audience in picking up the
sense of the fourth Act of the play, which contains in overwhelming measure Sanskrit
stanzas, and, therefore, must have been extremely difficult for the audience to follow.
The date of the change is uncertain; on linguistic grounds it has been placed after
Hemacandra and before the date of the <i>Prākṛta Pin̄gala</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n275.1src" href="#n275.1">83</a>

<h2 class="main">THE CHARACTERISTICS AND ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SANSKRIT DRAMA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sanskrit drama may legitimately be regarded as the highest product of Indian poetry,
and as summing up in itself the final conception of literary art achieved by the very
self-conscious creators of Indian literature. This art was essentially aristocratic;
the drama was never popular in the sense in which the Greek drama possessed that quality.
From an early period in Indian history we find the distinction of class reflected
in a distinction of language; culture was reserved largely for the two higher castes,
the Brahmin and the Kṣatriya or ruling class. It was in this rarified atmosphere that
the Sanskrit drama came into being, and it was probably to litterati of high cultivation
that its creation from the hints present in religion and in the epic was due. The
Brahmin, in fact, much abused as he has been in this as in other matters, was the
source of the intellectual distinction of India. As he produced Indian philosophy,
so by another effort of his intellect he evolved the subtle and effective form of
the drama. Brahmins, it must be remembered, had long been the inheritors of the epic
tradition, and this tradition they turned to happy use in the evolution of the drama.
</p>
<p>The drama bears, therefore, essential traces of its connexion with the Brahmins. They
were idealist in outlook, capable of large generalizations, but regardless of accuracy
in detail, and to create a realistic drama was wholly incompatible with their temperament.
The accurate delineation of facts or character was to them nothing; they aimed at
the creation in the mind of the audience of sentiment, and what was necessary for
this end was all that was attempted. All poetry was, in the later analysis, which
is implicit in the practice of the earlier poets, essentially a means of suggesting
feeling, and this function devolved most of <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>all on the drama. Nothing, therefore, is of value save what tends to this end, and
it is the function of the true dramatist to lay aside everything which is irrelevant
for this purpose.
</p>
<p>It follows from this principle that the plot is a secondary element<a class="noteRef" id="n277.1src" href="#n277.1">1</a> in the drama in its highest form, the heroic play or Nāṭaka. To complicate it would
divert the mind from emotion to intellectual interest, and affect injuriously the
production of sentiment. The dramatist, therefore, will normally choose a well-known
theme which in itself is apt to place the spectator in the appropriate frame of mind
to be affected by the appropriate emotion. It is then his duty by the skill with which
he handles his theme to bring out in the fullest degree the sentiment appropriate
to the piece. This is in essentials the task set before themselves by the great dramatists;
Kālidāsa makes subtle changes in the story of Çakuntalā, not for the sake of improving
the plot as such, but because the alterations are necessary to exhibit in perfection
the sentiment of love, which must be evoked in the hearts of the audience. The crudities
of the epic tale left Çakuntalā a business-like young woman and Duḥṣanta a selfish
and calculating lover; both blemishes had to be removed in order that the spectator
might realize within himself, in ideal form, the tenderness of a girl’s first affection,
and the honourable devotion of the king, clouded only by a curse against which he
had no power.
</p>
<p>The emotions which thus it was desired to evoke were, however, strictly limited by
the Brahminical theory of life. The actions and status of man in any existence depend
on no accident; they are essentially the working out of deeds done in a previous birth,
and these again are explained by yet earlier actions from time without beginning.
Indian drama is thus deprived of a motif which is invaluable to Greek tragedy, and
everywhere provides a deep and profound tragic element, the intervention of forces
beyond control or calculation in the affairs of man, confronting his mind with obstacles
upon which the greatest intellect and the most determined will are shattered. A conception
of this kind would deprive the working of the law of the act of all validity, and,
however much in popular ideas the inexorable character of the act might be obscured
by notions of <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>an age before the evolution of the belief of the inevitable operation of the act,
in the deliberate form of expression in drama this principle could not be forgotten.
We lose, therefore, the spectacle of the good man striving in vain against an inexorable
doom; we lose even the wicked man whose power of intellect and will make us admire
him, even though we welcome his defeat. The wicked man who perishes is merely, in
the view of the Sanskrit drama, a criminal undergoing punishment, for whose sufferings
we should feel no sympathy whatever; such a person is not a suitable hero for any
drama, and it is a mere reading of modern sentiment into ancient literature to treat
Duryodhana in the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i> as the hero of the drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n278.1src" href="#n278.1">2</a> He justly pays the full penalty for insolence and contempt of Viṣṇu.
</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that the sentiments which are to be evoked by a Sanskrit Nāṭaka
are essentially the heroic or the erotic, with that of wonder as a valued subordinate
element, appropriate in the <i>dénouement</i>. The wonderful well consorts with the ideal characters of legend, which accepts without
incredulity or discomfort the intervention of the divine in human affairs, and therefore
follows with ready acceptance the solution of the knot in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> or the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>. Heroism and love, of course, cannot be evoked without the aid of episodes which
menace the hero and heroine with the failure to attain their aims; there must be danger
and interference with the course of true love, but the final result must see concord
achieved. Hence it is impossible to expect that any drama shall be a true tragedy;
in the long run the hero and the heroine must be rewarded by perfect happiness and
union. The <i>Nāgānanda</i> of Harṣa illustrates the rule to perfection; the sublimity of self-sacrifice suggests
real tragedy, but this would be wholly out of harmony with the spirit of India, and
the intervention of Gaurī is invoked to secure that the self-sacrifice is crowned
by a complete and immediate reward in this life. The figure of an Antigone might have
been paralleled in Indian life; it would not be acceptable to the spirit of Indian
drama.
</p>
<p>Idealist as it is, the spirit of the drama declines to permit of a division of sentiment;
it will not allow the enemy of the hero to rival him in any degree; nothing is more
striking than the <span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>failure to realize the possibility of a great dramatic creation presented by the character
of Rāvaṇa as the rival of Rāma for Sītā’s love. Rāvaṇa varies in the hands of the
dramatists, but all tend to reduce him to the status of a boastful and rather stupid
villain, who is inferior at every point to his rival. Equally effectively the drama
banishes from the possibilities the conception of a struggle of conscience in the
mind of the hero or the heroin;<a class="noteRef" id="n279.1src" href="#n279.1">3</a> if this were represented, it would create a similar struggle in the mind of the audience,
and destroy the unity and purity of the sentiment, which it is the part of the drama
to generate.
</p>
<p>The style similarly is explained and justified by the end of suggesting sentiment.
The lyric stanzas, at first sight strangely undramatic,<a class="noteRef" id="n279.2src" href="#n279.2">4</a> find their full explanation when it is remembered how effective each is in exciting
the appropriate emotion in the mind of the audience, which, deeply versed in Sanskrit
poetry, is keen to appreciate the effect of each stanza. The simplicity or even negligence
of the prose of the drama is thus also explained and excused. It is not necessary
to excite sentiment; it serves merely as the mode of communicating facts, and of enabling
the audience to follow the action, until an opportunity is afforded to excite feeling
by the melody of a verse, all the more effective from its sudden emergence from the
flatness of its environment. The same consideration explains the importance of those
elements of which we can form so faint an impression, the dance, music, song, and
the mimetic art. The elaborate code of gestures laid down in the theory, and unquestionably
bulking large in practice, was all intended to produce in cultivated spirits the sentiments
appropriate to the play.
</p>
<p>The ideal character of the heroic drama extends itself even to the Nāṭikā, where a
closer approach to real life might be expected. The dramatists, however, make no attempt
at realism; they choose their subjects from the legend, and they cast over the trivial
<i>amourettes</i> of their heroes the glamour derived from the assurance that the winning in marriage
of a maiden will <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>assure them universal rule. The action of the play is thus not suffered to degenerate
into a portrayal of the domestic difficulties of the harem system under polygamic
conditions; the dramatists do not seek realism, but are content to reproduce a stereotyped
scheme of love, jealousy, parting, and reunion, a sequence well calculated to evoke
the sentiment of love in the mind of the audience. Even in the Prakaraṇa, in which
realism might be expected, seeing that it condescends to heroes of less than royal
or divine status, there is no actual exception: though the author of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> has had the power to infuse a semblance of life and actuality into his characters,
Bhavabhūti shows us in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> nothing but types suggesting the erotic sentiment. Equally ideal is the Vyāyoga with
its suggestion of heroism and its deliberate selection of its subject from the epic
tradition.
</p>
<p>Tragedy proper is denied us by these conditions of Indian thought, and comedy in any
of its higher forms is also difficult; it might legitimately be expected to prevail
in the Nāṭikā or the Prakaraṇa, but it is unduly subordinated to the erotic sentiment
and, though not absent, is comparatively undeveloped. The Prahasana and the Bhāṇa
indeed appeal to the comic sentiment, but only in an inferior and degraded form, a
fact expressed in the failure of the classical drama to preserve a single specimen
of either form of composition.
</p>
<p>Limited by the nature of the intellectual movement which produced it, the Sanskrit
drama could never achieve the perfection of Greek tragedy or comedy. Kālidāsa, greatest
of Indian dramatists, experiences no uneasiness at the structure of life or the working
of the world. He accepts without question or discontent the fabric of Indian society.
When Goethe writes of him:
</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Willst du die Blüthe des frühen, die Früchte des späteren Jahres, </p>
<p class="line xd32e9691">Willst du, was reizt und entzückt, willst du, was sättigt und nährt, </p>
<p class="line">Willst du den Himmel, die Erde, mit einem Namen begreifen, </p>
<p class="line xd32e9691">Nenn’ ich Çakuntalā dich, und so ist alles gesagt, </p>
</div>
<p class="first">the praise is doubtless just in a measure, but it may easily be pressed further than
is justifiable. For the deeper questions of <span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>human life Kālidāsa has no message for us; they raised, so far as we can see, no question
in his own mind; the whole Brahmanical system, as restored to glory under the Guptas,
seems to have satisfied him, and to have left him at peace with the universe. Fascinating
and exquisite as is the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, it moves in a narrow world, removed far from the cruelty of real life, and it neither
seeks to answer, nor does it solve, the riddles of life. Bhavabhūti, it is true, shows
some sense of the complexity and difficulty of existence, of the conflict between
one duty and another, and the sorrow thus resulting, but with him also there prevailed
the rule that all must end in harmony. Sītā, who in the older story is actually finally
taken away from the husband who allowed himself to treat her as if her purity were
sullied by her captivity in Rāvaṇa’s hands, is restored to Rāma by divine favour,
an ending infinitely less dramatic than final severance after vindication. How serious
a limitation in dramatic outlook is produced by the Brahmanical theory of life, the
whole history of the Sanskrit drama shows.<a class="noteRef" id="n281.1src" href="#n281.1">5</a> Moreover, acceptance of the Brahmanic tradition permits the production of such a
play as the <i>Caṇḍakauçika</i>, where reason and humanity are revolted beyond measure by the insane vengeance taken
by the sage Viçvāmitra on the unfortunate king for an act of charity.
</p>
<p>The drama suffered also from its close dependence on the epic, and the failure of
the poets to recognize that the epic subjects were often as a whole undramatic. Hence
frequently, as in the vast majority of the Rāma dramas and those based on the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, we have nothing but the recasting of the epic narrative into a semi-dramatic form,
without real dramatic structure. There was nothing in the theory to hint at the error
of such a course; on the contrary, to the poets the subject was one admirably suitable,
since in itself it suggested the appropriate sentiments, and therefore left them merely
the duty of heightening the effects. This led on the high road to the outward signs
of the degradation of the drama, the abandoning of any interest in anything save the
production of lyric or narrative stanzas of perfection of form, judged in accordance
with a taste which progressively declined into a rejection of simplicity and <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>the search for what was recondite. To the later poets the drama is an exercise in
style, and that, as contrasted with the highest products of Indian literature, a fantastic
and degraded one.
</p>
<p>To the Brahmin ideal individuality has no appeal; the law of life has no room for
deviation from type; the caste system is rigid, and for each rank in life there is
a definite round of duties, whence departure is undesirable and dangerous. The drama
likewise has no desire for individual figures, but only for typical characters. The
defect from the Aristotelian as from the modern point of view of the Rāma dramas is
simply that Rāma is conceived as an ideal, a man without faults, and therefore for
us lacking in the essential traits of humanity. Similarly, in the style of the drama
we are denied any differentiation of individuals as contrasted with classes. The divergence
in the use of Sanskrit or Prākrit, and in the different kinds of Prākrit, marks the
essential distinction of men and women, and of those of high and those of humble rank,
but beyond this characterization does not go. We are treated to an artificial court
speech, which assorts with stereotyped emotions, refined, elegant, sentimental, rich
in the compliments of court gallantly, often pathetic, marked with a distinct strain
of philosophical commonplace, and fond of suggested meanings and <i>double entendres</i>, hinting at the events yet to come. But the dramatists made no serious attempt to
create individual characters, and to assign to them a speech of their own; they vary
greatly in merit as regards characterization, but even the best dramas paint types,
not individuals.
</p>
<p>Indifference to individuality necessarily meant indifference to action, and therefore
to plot, and this lies at the basis of the steady progress by which the dialogue was
neglected in favour of the stanzas. The latter express the general; they draw highly
condensed, but also often extremely poetical, pictures of the beauty of nature in
one of its many aspects, or of the charms of the beloved; or they enunciate the Brahmanical
solutions of the problems of life and conduct. In them the individual has no place;
the beloved may be described, but she is merely typical. These stanzas appealed to
the audience; we have no echo in India of the criticisms which were levelled in Greece
against Euripides, for the introduction of sentiments unfitted to his characters and
the scenes involved, and we have no hint that <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>Indian theory ever recognized that the drama by the tenth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> was in a state of decadence.
</p>
<p>The peculiar and limited view of the drama was intimately connected with its Brahmanical
character. The drama of Greece was popular; it appealed to all free Athenian citizens,<a class="noteRef" id="n283.1src" href="#n283.1">6</a> an infinitely wider class than that for which the dramas of India in Sanskrit and
Prākrit were composed, and it was written in a language easily comprehended by all
those who viewed the spectacle. From the period of the earliest dramas known to us
the full comprehension of the words can have been confined to a limited section of
the audience, which, however, had sufficient pleasure in the spectacle, in the song,
the pantomimic dances, and the music, and sufficient general comprehension of the
drama to follow it adequately enough. Such an audience, however, acted as a stimulus
to refinement and elaboration; the dramatist could neglect the prime necessity of
being understood which weighed on the Greek dramatist, and indulge in the production
of something recondite, calculated to manifest his skill in metrical form and management
of words. The fact that Sanskrit was not a normal living language presented him with
the temptation, to which none of the later dramatists rises superior, of the free
use of the vast store of alleged synonyms presented by the lexica,<a class="noteRef" id="n283.2src" href="#n283.2">7</a> freed from any inconvenient necessity, such as exists in every living language, of
using words only in that precise nuance which every synonym possesses in a living
dialect.
</p>
<p>The same tendency to artificiality was undoubtedly stimulated by the fact that plays
for their reputation must have depended largely on being read, not witnessed, however
important it may have been for the poet to secure the honour of public performance.
The popularity and number of the Kāvyas which have come down to us attests the existence
of an effective public which, if it did not read the works, at least enjoyed having
them read aloud, and the dramatist was thus encouraged, while adhering to the dramatic
form, to vie in this genre of literature with the effects produced in the Kāvya. The
Kāvya, however, <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>was undergoing throughout its history a tendency to seek mere stylistic effects, and
this influence must largely have contributed to the elaboration of style of the drama.
It is significant that the Kāvyas and dramas of Kālidāsa show a relative simplicity
which contrasts effectively with the complexities of Bhavabhūti in drama, and Bhāravi
and Māgha in the Kāvya.
</p>
<p>To understand the Indian drama we have aid from a work of curious character and importance,
the <i>Kāmaçāstra</i> or <i>Kāmasūtra</i> of Vātsyāyana,<a class="noteRef" id="n284.1src" href="#n284.1">8</a> which was doubtless familiar to the dramatists from Kālidāsa onwards. The world which
produced the classical drama was one in which the pessimism of Buddhism, with its
condemnation of the value of pleasure, had given way to the worship of the great sectarian
divinities Çiva and Viṣṇu, in whose service the enjoyment of pleasure was legitimate
and proper. The Buddhists themselves admittedly felt the force of the demand for a
life of ease; we have preserved verses satirizing their love of women, wine, soft
living, and luxury, and there is abundant evidence of the decline of austerity in
the order. The eclecticism of Harṣa is sufficiently significant; the policy which
at the great festival at Prayāga reported by <span class="corr" id="xd32e11013" title="Source: Hiuan Tsang">Hiuan-Tsang</span> resulted in the dedication of a statue to the Buddha on the first day, to the sun,
the favourite deity of his father, on the second, and to Çiva on the third, excludes
any possibility of belief in the depth of Harṣa’s Buddhist beliefs. If there were
any doubt as to the strange transformation of feeling among Buddhists, it would be
removed by the benediction which opens the <i>Nāgānanda</i>, where the Buddha is invoked as rallied on his hardheartedness by the ladies of Māra’s
train. The process of accommodation had evidently gone very far. The philosophy of
the age shows equally the lack of serious interest in the old tenets of Buddhism;
we have the great development of logical studies in lieu of insistence on the truths
of misery and the path to its removal, while the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of the period outside Buddhist circles is the complicated and fantastic system of
the Sāṁkhya philosophy, which adequately reflects the artistic spirit of the time
in its comparison of nature with a dancer who makes her début, and gracefully retires
from the stage when she has satisfied her audience. The spirit of Açoka has entirely
disappeared <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>from the royal families of India, and the courts demanded amusement with refinement,
just as they sought for elegance in art. The interests of this world are centred in
the pleasures of life, the festivals which amused the court and the people by the
pomp of their celebration from time to time, and in the intervals the amusements of
the palace and the harem, sports in the water, the game of the swing, the plucking
of flowers, song, dance, pantomime, and such other diversions as were necessary to
while away the endless leisure of princes, who left the business of their realms to
ministers and soldiers, while they spared themselves any fatigue more serious than
that of love encounters. The manners of their princes were aped by their rich subjects,
and there was no dearth of courtiers and parasites to aid them in their diversions.
The man about town (<i>nāgaraka</i>) as sketched by the <i>Kāmasūtra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n285.1src" href="#n285.1">9</a> is rich and cultivated; devoted to the niceties of attire and personal adornment,
perfumed, pomaded, and garlanded; he is a musician, and a lover of books; cage-birds
afford him pleasure of the eyes, and diversion in teaching them speech; a lovely garden
with an arbour presents facilities for amusement and repose. In the daytime the care
of the toilet, cock fights, ram fights, excursions in the neighbouring country, fill
his time; while at night, after a concert or ballet, there are the joys of love, in
which the <i>Kāmasūtra</i> gives him more elaborate instruction than the <i lang="la">Ars Amoris</i> ever contemplated. The luxury of polygamy did not suffice such a man; he is allowed
to enjoy the society of courtesans, and in them, as in Athens, he finds the intellectual
interests which are denied to his legitimate wives. With them and the more refined
and cultured of the band of hangers-on, high and low, with whom he is surrounded,
he can indulge in the pleasures of the discussion of literature, and appreciate the
fine efforts of the poets and dramatists. From such a nature, of course, anything
heroic cannot be expected, and the poets recognize this state of affairs; but it demands
refinement, beauty, luxury, and the demand is fully met. Love is naturally a capital
theme, but the dramatists suffer from one grave difficulty from the condition of the
society which they depict. The ideal of a romantic love between two persons free and
independent, masters of their own destinies, is in great measure denied <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>to them, and they are reduced to the banality of the intrigue between the king and
the damsel who is destined to be his wife, but who by some accident has been introduced
into his harem in a humble position.
</p>
<p>For the dramatists the favour of a king was the chief object to be aimed at, and kings
were evidently very willing to lend their names to dramatic and other compositions,
whatever part they actually took in their production. The persistence of the rumour
which regards Harṣa as winning his fame in part at the expense of Bāṇa, may be unjust
to the king, but at any rate it expresses what was popular belief in the possibility
of such a happening in poetical circles, and it is indeed incredible that a king should
have been so scrupulous as to refuse any aid in his literary toils from his court
poets. Competitions in exhibitions of poetry were in favour with monarchs, but they
were not the only patrons; their actions excited imitation,<a class="noteRef" id="n286.1src" href="#n286.1">10</a> and even in Buddhist and Jain circles the desire to adopt the expedient of drama
in connexion with religion was evinced. But even when applied by Brahmins, Buddhists,
or Jains to philosophy or religion, the drama bore throughout the unmistakable stamp
of its original predominance in circles whose chief interest was gallantry: the <i>Nāgānanda</i> bears eloquent evidence of this for Buddhist ideas<span class="corr" id="xd32e11056" title="Not in source">,</span> the <i>Prabodhacandrodaya</i> for Brahmin philosophy, and the <i>Moharājaparājaya</i> for Jainism.
</p>
<p>A society of this kind was certain to encourage refinement and elegance in poetry;
it was equally certain to lead to artificiality and unreality. But we may be certain
that true poetic taste existed; it is attested not merely by the existence and fame
of such dramas as those of Kālidāsa, but in the kindred sphere of music it has an
interesting exposition in the third Act of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, in which, following with slight changes the precedent of Bhāsa, Cārudatta is made
to express to the unresponsive ears of Maitreya, his one faithful friend, the effect
produced on his ears by the sweet singing of Rebhila, which has come to console him
in the midst of his sorrow:<a class="noteRef" id="n286.2src" href="#n286.2">11</a>

</div>
<p class="first">To Rājaçekhara<a class="noteRef" id="n287.1src" href="#n287.1">12</a> we owe a full account of the studies which went to make up the finished poet, who
had the choice of Sanskrit, Prākrit, Apabhraṅça, and Paiçācī, or the speech of the
goblins (<i>bhūtabhāṣā</i>), as his modes of composition. Knowledge of grammar, of the dictionary, poetics,
and metrics are demanded, as well as skill in the sixty-four acts; purity of mind,
speech, and body are requisite, as well as most attractive surroundings. The poet’s
male attendants are to speak Apabhraṅça, the female Māgadhī, while those within the
harem itself are to use Prākrit and Sanskrit, and his friends to exercise themselves
in all forms of speech. With pardonable lack of historical truth, we are told anecdotes
of kings who forbade the use in their harems of certain letters, and combinations
of sounds, on grounds of euphony, and the poet may imitate their usage. We also learn
that Sanskrit was affected among the people of Bengal, in Lāṭa Prākrit, in Mārwār,
and by the Ṭakkas and Bhādānakas, Apabhraṅça, while in Avantī, Pariyātra, and Daçapura
Bhūtabhāṣā prevailed. The people of Surāṣṭra and the Travaṇas are credited elsewhere<a class="noteRef" id="n287.2src" href="#n287.2">13</a> with intermingling Sanskrit and Apabhraṅça, while unkind comments are made on the
mode of pronouncing Sanskrit among the excellent poets of Kashmir, and on the nasal
accent of the north as opposed to the music of that in Pañcāla. We learn also<a class="noteRef" id="n287.3src" href="#n287.3">14</a> that poets were wont to make journeys, and to utilize the knowledge of other places
thus gained in their works.
</p>
<p>Rājaçekhara<a class="noteRef" id="n287.4src" href="#n287.4">15</a> is also emphatic regarding the capacity of women: <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>daughters of kings or ministers, courtesans, and wives of jesters, were skilled as
poets, the capacity which brings about the ability to compose being a matter affecting
the soul, and not, therefore, bound up with sex. To Rājaçekhara the ability to write
poems is largely due to experiences in previous births, and he logically denies that
sex can affect this. But though verses are cited from the poetesses in the anthologies,
and not a few names are known, and Avantisundarī, Rājaçekhara’s own wife, appears
to have been an authority on poetics, it is certain that no drama of importance has
come down to us which is written by a woman. The explanation for this would seem rather
to lie in social conventions, as in Greece, for there is no reason to suppose that
the clever women mentioned by Rājaçekhara, and doubtless not rare in the courts, could
not have composed plays of merit.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Pāṇini, whose date falls doubtless before 300 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, alludes in his grammar to the <i>Naṭasūtras</i>, books of rules for Naṭas, compiled by Çilālin and Kṛçāçva, and Professor Hillebrandt<a class="noteRef" id="n290.1src" href="#n290.1">1</a> has suggested that we should recognize in these works the earliest text-books of
the Indian drama. But we have no other suggestion that Pāṇini knew of dramatic performances,
and the only legitimate conclusion is that these rules were laid down for the guidance
of dancers or, perhaps, pantomimes, and with this accords admirably the fact that
the dramatic tradition knows nothing of these names, and instead makes the sage Bharata
the eponymous hero of the drama. True it was Brahmā, highest of gods, himself who,
at the instance of the gods, produced as a counterpart to the four Vedas, which contain
the science of religion and magic, the more mundane Nāṭya-Veda, consecrated to the
drama, but this Veda is not current among men. Bharata, on the other hand, whose task
it was to direct the production by the Apsarases in heaven of plays for the delight
of the gods and who thus had practical experience of the art, has set forth for men
the principles of the drama in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> which, if not inspired, has at least a measure of sanctity, and thus supplies an
authoritative basis for practice.
</p>
<p>The legend is interesting because it precisely interprets the spirit of India towards
authority; Bharata occupies in the theory of the drama a place analogous to that of
Pāṇini in grammar, but unfortunately the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> has fared badly in comparison with the <i>Aṣṭādhyāyī</i>, which has, through the care of its commentators, come down to us in a form but little
changed from that it assumed in the hands of its author. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>work, which we have under the title <i>Bhāratīya Nāṭyaçāstra</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n291.1src" href="#n291.1">2</a> is extremely badly preserved in the manuscript tradition, a fact due in part to the
comparatively late date of any commentary upon it. We have only a few references to
an exposition of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> by Mātṛgupta, a somewhat mysterious figure with a more or less legendary connexion
with Kālidāsa, with whom he has even been identified;<a class="noteRef" id="n291.2src" href="#n291.2">3</a> if we are to place any faith in his contemporaneity with Kālidāsa, he may date from
the close of the fourth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span> It is significant that tradition makes him for a time king of Kashmir, for it is
to that country we owe the commentaries of Çan̄kuka, who wrote the epic <i>Bhuvanābhyudaya</i> under Ajitāpīḍa (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 813–50), and of Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka, who belongs to the period of Çan̄karavarman (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 883–902). In the same line of tradition is the great work of Abhinavagupta, the <i>Abhinavabhāratī</i>, which has been lucky enough to come to light after long oblivion, and which represents
the erudition of the close of the tenth century.
</p>
<p>The treatise, as we have it, is elaborate, covering the whole ground connected with
the drama. It deals with the architecture of the theatre, the scenery, and the dress
and equipment of the actors; the religious ceremonial to be observed at every representation;
the music, the dance, the movements and gestures of the actors, and their mode of
delivery; the division of rôles; the general characteristics of poetry; the different
classes of drama, and the emotions and sentiments which form a vital element in the
drama. There is confusion, complexity, and repetition in the work, but that much of
it is old cannot be doubted. It appears clearly to be based on the examination of
a dramatic literature which has been lost, eclipsed by the more perfect dramas of
Kālidāsa and his successors. In the description of classes of drama we seem to have
hasty generalizations on insufficient material; the Samavakāra, for instance, is described
in terms <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>which, with the precise definition of the time to be occupied by the acts, can be
interpreted only as based on a single drama, and the Ḍima seems to have a similar
origin. The elaborate description of the preliminary scene or Pūrvaran̄ga, which is
practically non-existent in the classical drama, suggests a period of a less cultivated
taste. A more definite result may be derived from comparison of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> with the works of Açvaghoṣa and of Bhāsa. The Prākrits recognized by the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> are clearly later than those of Açvaghoṣa and more akin to those found in Bhāsa;
again the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> recognizes the use of Ardha-Māgadhī, found in these two dramatists, but not later,
while, like them, he ignores the Māhārāṣṭrī of the later dramas. Moreover Bhāsa expressly
alludes to a <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n292.1src" href="#n292.1">4</a> and it is most probable that both he and Kālidāsa had knowledge of the prototype
of the present text. That Bhāsa by no means slavishly adheres to the rules of the
<i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, either as regards the formal mode of terminating his dramas or the exclusion of
scenes of death from the stage,<a class="noteRef" id="n292.2src" href="#n292.2">5</a> merely shows that when he wrote the Çāstra had not attained any binding force. There
is nothing to contradict the date thus vaguely indicated,<a class="noteRef" id="n292.3src" href="#n292.3">6</a> for the treatment of poetics in general is simple and early, and it is impossible
to draw any conclusion as to date from the remarks on music, apart altogether from
the constant possibility that incidental additions and alterations have been made
in the work.
</p>
<p>It was inevitable that the complicated and confused work of Bharata should be superseded
for many purposes by something more accessible and easy to follow, and this need was
supplied by the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e11229" title="Source: Dāçarūpa">Daçarūpa</span></i> of Dhanaṁjaya, son of Viṣṇu, and <i>protégé</i> of the ill-fated king Muñja of Dhārā (974–95). The work takes its name from the ten
primary forms of drama recognized in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, which is followed closely by Dhanaṁjaya, his deviations being unimportant and trivial,
such as a new division of types of heroine or of the erotic sentiment. On the other
hand, Dhanaṁjaya omits by far the greater part of the topics of <span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>his model; his four books of wooden verses treat first of the subject-matter and plot;
then of the hero, the heroine, and other characters, and the language of the drama;
thirdly of the prologue and the different kinds of drama; and lastly of the emotions
and sentiments, thus concentrating attention on the essential dramatic features. The
text is naturally often unintelligible save in the light of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> itself and of the commentary, <i>Avaloka</i>, which is ascribed to Dhanika, son of Viṣṇu, and minister of Utpaladeva, a term which
is an alias of Muñja. The identity of the two writers is suggested by the fact that
later writers ascribe passages of the <i>Daçarūpa</i> itself to Dhanika, and that without the commentary the work is in a sense incomplete.
But, on the other hand, in a few passages the commentator more or less distinctly
differs from the text, and it seems sufficient to assume that they may have been brothers.
The <i>Avaloka</i> must have been completed after Muñja’s death, since it cites Padmagupta’s <i>Navasāhasān̄kacarita</i>, which was written under Sindhurāja, and this throws some doubt on the identification
of Dhanika with the Dhanika Paṇḍita to whose son, Vasantācārya, a land grant was made
by Muñja in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 974. Dhanika quotes stanzas of his own in Sanskrit and Prākrit and also a treatise,
<i>Kāvyanirṇaya</i>, elsewhere unknown.<a class="noteRef" id="n293.1src" href="#n293.1">7</a>
</p>
<p>Of the fourteenth century in all probability are three works of unequal importance
and merit. The <i>Pratāparudrīya</i><a class="noteRef" id="n293.2src" href="#n293.2">8</a> of Vidyānātha is a mediocre compilation from the <i>Daçarūpa</i> and the <i>Kāvyaprakāça</i> of Mammaṭa, covering the whole field of poetics; it illustrates the formal rules
of the drama by the composition of a wretched drama in honour of Pratāparudra of Warangal,
whose inscriptions show dates from <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1298 to 1314. Of much greater interest is Vidyādhara’s <i>Ekāvalī</i>;<a class="noteRef" id="n293.3src" href="#n293.3">9</a> like Vidyānātha, the author celebrates in his illustrations of his text his patron,
in this case Narasiṅha II of Orissa, perhaps <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1280–1314; as a poet his merits are negligible, but he shows a lively interest in
his subject and intelligence in his views. Of greater popularity than either <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>is Viçvanātha Kavirāja, the author of the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n294.1src" href="#n294.1">10</a> a general treatise on poetics. His handling of the drama is based largely on the
<i>Daçarūpa</i> and its commentary, but he introduces a good deal of matter from the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> in his sixth chapter, including details of the characteristics and ornaments of the
drama, which the <i>Daçarūpa</i> omits. In this Viçvanātha indicates his servile character, which, however, renders
his work the more valuable as an exposition of the orthodox doctrine. Of his ancestry
and his own works he makes free mention, but the most definite evidence of his date
is the existence in the library at Jammu of a manuscript of his work whose date appears
to be <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1383. The lack of order and the errors in his work are made the basis of criticism
by Rūpa Gosvāmin in the early part of the sixteenth century, but his own <i>Nāṭakacandrikā</i> shows little improvement on the work of his predecessor, whence it draws much of
its material; its real purpose is to eulogize the saint Caitanya, whose disciple Rūpa
was and in whose honour he composed dramas of no merit. Equally dependent on Viçvanātha
and the <i>Daçarūpa</i> is Sundaramiçra, whose <i>Nāṭyapradīpa</i> was composed in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1613. Many other treatises on drama are known by name or exist in manuscript, but
none apparently of any great importance or repute. Of the fourteenth century also
is the <i>Rasārṇavasudhākara</i><a class="noteRef" id="n294.2src" href="#n294.2">11</a> of Çin̄ga <span class="corr" id="xd32e11319" title="Source: Bhūpala">Bhūpāla</span>, lord of Rājācala and the land between the Vindhya and Çrīçaila about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1330, who cites Vidyādhara.
</p>
<p>The development of a theory of drama progressed in the closest relation to the general
theory of poetics, for the Indian theory of poetry does not admit any distinction
in essence between the aesthetic pleasure produced by the drama and any other form
of poetry. Thus we find in Abhinavagupta in full application to the drama the theory
of suggestion, Dhvani, as the essence of poetry, which appeared in strength about
<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 800 and was rendered popular by Ānandavardhana (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 850) and by Abhinavagupta himself in his comment on the <i>Dhvanyāloka</i> of the former. Attacked by Mahiman Bhaṭṭa, author of the <i>Vyaktiviveka</i> (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1050), the doctrine was again developed with special <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>care by the Kashmirian Mammaṭa<a class="noteRef" id="n295.1src" href="#n295.1">12</a> at the close of the eleventh century. In slightly varied forms it appears in Vidyānātha,
Vidyādhara, and Viçvanātha.
</p>
<p>Apart from this important development, which, however, has no special application
to the drama, there is little progress in the course of the literature. The later
authorities are bound by the authority of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>; they repeat unintelligently its descriptions of literary forms such as the <span class="corr" id="xd32e11354" title="Source: Dima">Ḍima</span>, the Samavakāra, the Īhāmṛga, the Vīthī, and the An̄ka, which had ceased to be in
popular use, if indeed the definitions of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> were not merely hasty generalizations from a single play or so in every one of these
cases. The most that they do is to omit or to vary details, but not in independence;
normally the changes can be traced to variants in the text of the Çāstra or to maxims
current under Bharata’s name, though not included in the Çāstra as we have it. Often
the authors differ in the definition of terms in the Çāstra which, as often in Sanskrit
technical phrases, present ambiguity and admit of various renderings. These divergences
are especially frequent in the long lists of characteristics and ornaments or the
different means of effecting dramatic results; the Indian love of meaningless subdivision
here can indulge itself to its fullest and least profitable extent. A rich variety
of such ambiguities is apparent in the verses in which the <i>Agni Purāṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n295.2src" href="#n295.2">13</a> describes the drama, including dancing and the mimetic art, true to its aim to constitute
itself a treasure-house of all learning, popular as well as divine. The chief value
of the work is the occasional light which it throws on the variants in the text of
the Çāstra, and its comparative antiquity, for it is cited in the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i> and is probably some centuries older.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Nature and the Types of the Drama</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A drama is the imitation or representation of the conditions or situations (<i>avasthānukṛti</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n295.3src" href="#n295.3">14</a> in which the personages who form the subject of treatment are placed from time to
time, by means of gesture, speech, costume, and expression, and, one version of <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>the definition adds, the situations must be such as to produce pleasure or pain, that
is, they must be tinged with emotion. It is the presence of these ancillaries which
distinguishes the drama from an ordinary poem; a poem appeals to the ear only, a drama
is also a spectacle to delight the eyes; hence the term Rūpa or Rūpaka as applied
generically to the drama, for Rūpa primarily denotes the object of vision, though
the Indian tradition gives the artificial explanation that Rūpaka denotes a drama
because the actors are credited with different parts.
</p>
<p>Further light is shown on the nature of drama (<i>nāṭya</i>) by the discrimination of it from dance (<i>nṛtta</i>) and mimetic art (<i>nṛtya</i>), which united with song and speech serve to make up the drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n296.1src" href="#n296.1">15</a> The dance is based on time and rhythm; the mimetic art is concerned with representing
the feelings or emotions (<i>bhāva</i>), while the essence of the drama is the sentiment (<i>rasa</i>) which it evokes in the spectator, a fact which places it on a higher level than
either of its handmaidens. But there may be dramas in which these auxiliaries take
first place, and on this fact is based a distinction between the primary forms, Rūpakas,
in which the poetry is the dominant element and the secondary forms, Uparūpakas. Of
Rūpakas ten are distinguished, Nāṭaka, Prakaraṇa, Bhāṇa, Prahasana, Ḍima, Vyāyoga,
Samavakāra, Vīthī, An̄ka, and Īhāmṛga, which vary in regard to subject-matter (<i>vastu</i>), hero or heroine, and sentiment.

<div id="ch13.3" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd32e1089">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> <i>The Subject-Matter and the Plot</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The scene of the plot must be laid in India, and the period must be one of the three
ages succeeding the Golden Age, for pleasure and pain, essential elements as we have
seen in the drama, cannot be experienced elsewhere than in Bhāratavarṣa, and even
there they do not exist in the age of happiness unalloyed.<a class="noteRef" id="n296.2src" href="#n296.2">16</a> Otherwise the choice is free; the poet may take an incident familiar from tradition
(<i>prakhyāta</i>), or may invent his plot (<i>utpādya</i>) or may combine both forms (<i>miçra</i>). But, if he follows a current legend, it is necessary that he shall not ruin the
effect of it by incongruous invention; he must confine his ingenuity to episodes,
for otherwise the audience will be painfully disturbed <span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>by departure from tradition. On the other hand, it is not merely legitimate but also
necessary that the dramatist should ennoble his hero, if tradition assigns to him
deeds incompatible with the character which he normally exhibits.<a class="noteRef" id="n297.1src" href="#n297.1">17</a> The epic is not encumbered with such considerations; it can represent Duḥṣanta as
merely forgetful of his vows to Çakuntalā, but Kālidāsa must clear the character of
the king from this seeming baseness by attributing his loss of memory to a curse provoked
by a negligence of the heroine herself. The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> admits, and seeks to explain, if not convincingly, the death of Vālin, king of the
monkeys, at the hands of the virtuous Rāma; Māyurāja in the <i>Udāttarāghava</i> passes over the episode in silence, while Bhavabhūti, with greater boldness, in the
<i>Mahāvīracarita</i> perverts tradition to represent Vālin as an ally of Rāvaṇa, and as slain by Rāma
in legitimate self-defence, and exonerates Kaikeyī.
</p>
<p>The subject-matter takes two forms, the principal (<i>ādhikārika</i>) and the incidental (<i>prāsan̄gika</i>) actions. The first owes its name to the fact that it is connected with the attainment
(<i>adhikāra</i>) of the purpose of the hero, whether that be love, or some material interest, or
duty, or two or all of these. In the incidental action the end achieved is not that
aimed at by the hero, but it serves as a means towards the fruition of his aims.<a class="noteRef" id="n297.2src" href="#n297.2">18</a> The incidental action may take the dimension of an episode (<i>patākā</i>), as is the case with the exploits of Sugrīva as an ally of Rāma, or it may be a
mere incident (<i>prakarī</i>), as in Act VI of the <i>Çakuntalā</i> the scene in which the two attendants converse.<a class="noteRef" id="n297.3src" href="#n297.3">19</a>
</p>
<p>An action, when developed in full, as normally it is in the Nāṭaka, the most perfect
of forms of drama, involves of necessity five stages of development (<i>avasthā</i>);<a class="noteRef" id="n297.4src" href="#n297.4">20</a> there must be as the beginning (<i>ārambha</i>) the desire to attain some end, which leads on to the determined effort (<i>prayatna</i>) to secure the object of desire; this leads to the stage in which success is felt
to be possible (<i>prāptyāçā</i>, <i>prāptisambhava</i>) having regard to the means available and the obstacles in the way of achievement;
then arrives the certainty of success (<i>niyatāpti</i>), if only some specific <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>difficulty can be surmounted; and finally the object is attained (<i>phalāgama</i>). Thus in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> we have the king’s first anticipation of seeing the heroine, then his eagerness to
find a device to meet her again; in Act IV we learn that the anger of the sage, Durvāsas,
has in some measure been appeased, and the possibility of the reunion of the king
and Çakuntalā now exists; in Act VI the discovery of the ring brings back to the king
remembrance, and the way for a reunion is paved, to be attained in the following act.
The <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, no less perfect an example of the minor type, the Nāṭikā, reveals to us the aims
of the minister to secure the union of the heroine and the king; a definite step to
this end is taken when the heroine decides to depict the face of Vatsa on the canvas;
in Act II the lovers are united for the moment, but subject to the risk of discovery
by the queen; then the king recognizes that his success in love depends on winning
the queen’s favour, which is successfully accomplished in the last act.
</p>
<p>There are also five elements of the plot (<i>arthaprakṛti</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="n298.1src" href="#n298.1">21</a> which the theory not very accurately parallels with the five stages of the action.
The first is the germ (<i>bīja</i>) whence springs the action, as in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> from Yaugandharāyaṇa’s scheme to secure the princess for the king. The second, with
change of metaphor, is the drop (<i>bindu</i>) which spreads out as oil on water; the course of the drama, which has seemed to
be interrupted, is again set in activity; thus in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, when the festival of the god of love is over, the princess gives a decisive impulse
to the motion of the drama by recognizing in him, whom she deemed the god himself,
the king for whom she was destined as a bride. The other three elements are the episode,
the incident, and the <i>dénouement</i> (<i>kārya</i>).
</p>
<p>Based on these parallel sets is a third division of the junctures<a class="noteRef" id="n298.2src" href="#n298.2">22</a> (<i>sandhi</i>), which carry each of the stages of the action to its natural close. They are the
opening (<i>mukha</i>), progression (<i>pratimukha</i>), <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>development (<i>garbha</i>), pause (<i>vimarça</i>), and conclusion (<i>nirvahaṇa</i>), corresponding clearly and closely with the stages<a class="noteRef" id="n299.1src" href="#n299.1">23</a> set out above. Thus in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> the opening extends from Act I to the point in Act II where the general departs;
the progression begins with the king’s confession to the Vidūṣaka of his deep love,
and extends to the close of Act III. The development occupies Acts IV and V, up to
the point where Gautamī uncovers the face of Çakuntalā; at this moment the curse darkens
the mind of the king, who, instead of rejoicing in reunion with his wife, pauses in
reflection, and this pause in the action extends to the close of Act VI, while the
conclusion is achieved in the last Act. In the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> the opening extends to that point in Act II, where Ratnāvalī decides to depict the
king as the only means of gazing on him whom she loves, but from whom she is jealously
kept by the queen; the progression extends then to the close of the Act; the development
occupies Act III, while the pause, due to the intervention of the queen, is brought
to an end by the mock fire of the palace in Act IV, and the remaining portion of that
Act gives the conclusion.
</p>
<p>So far there is obviously force and reason in the analysis, which, if in needless
elaboration, recognizes the essential need of a dramatic conflict, of obstacles to
be overcome by the hero and heroine in their efforts to secure abiding union. The
classification of elements of the plot is perhaps superfluous beside the junctures;
its parallelism to the other two divisions is faulty, for it is admitted that the
episode is not confined to the development, as it should be, but may extend into the
pause and even into the conclusion.<a class="noteRef" id="n299.2src" href="#n299.2">24</a> The episode again is credited with sub-junctures, to be fewer in number than the
junctures, and even the incident is permitted on one view to have incomplete junctures.<a class="noteRef" id="n299.3src" href="#n299.3">25</a> But far more complex is the insistence on the subdivision of the five junctures into
64 members (12, 13, 12, 13, and 14 respectively). The distribution, however, has no
real value, for, though Rudraṭa<a class="noteRef" id="n299.4src" href="#n299.4">26</a> asserts that the members should only be used <span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>in the juncture to which they are assigned, other authorities decline to admit this
view, on the score of the usage of the dramatists, which is the supreme norm. Not
all of these members need be used; it is a fault in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i> that the poet drags in the separation of Duryodhana from Bhānumatī in Act II for
no better reason than to comply with the rules.<a class="noteRef" id="n300.1src" href="#n300.1">27</a> When used, they should be essentially subservient to the sentiment which the piece
seeks to create;<a class="noteRef" id="n300.2src" href="#n300.2">28</a> they should either treat the subject chosen, expand the plot, increase interest,
produce surprise, represent the parties in action, or conceal what should be concealed;
the hero or his rival should appear in them, or at any rate they should flow from
the germ and lead up to the <i>dénouement</i>. Some must be included in any drama, since one without any would be like a man without
limbs, and, adroitly used, they may give merit to a mediocre subject-matter. But the
definitions and the classifications are without substantial interest or value.
</p>
<p>A distinction must be made between such things as can properly be shown on the stage,
and such as must only be alluded to.<a class="noteRef" id="n300.3src" href="#n300.3">29</a> What is seen should essentially serve to produce the sentiment aimed at, and it must
avoid offending the feelings of the audience. Hence it is improper to portray on the
stage such events as a national calamity, the downfall of a king, the siege of a town,
a battle, killing, or death, all of them painful. It is equally forbidden to depict
a marriage or other<a class="noteRef" id="n300.4src" href="#n300.4">30</a> religious rite, or such domestic details as eating, sleeping, bathing, or anointing
the body, amorous dalliance, scratching with nails or teeth, or such ill-omened things
as curses. But these rules are not without exception early or late; if Bhāsa does
not hesitate as in the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i> to depict death on the stage, Rājaçekhara in his <i>Viddhaçālabhañjikā</i> describes the marriage ceremonial in Act III, and in the following Act shows us the
wife of Cārāyaṇa asleep, while the author of the <i>Pārvatīpariṇaya</i> does not hesitate to choose as his theme the nuptials of Çiva and Pārvatī. Nor do
dramatists decline to represent death if the dead person is restored to life, as in
the <i>Nāgānanda</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n300.5src" href="#n300.5">31</a> A long journey, or calling <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>from a distance,<a class="noteRef" id="n301.1src" href="#n301.1">32</a> is excluded from representation for obvious reasons of practicability.
</p>
<p>Such matters as are appropriate for presentation must be presented in Acts, and each
Act must contain only such events as can naturally, or by skilful management, be made
to occupy the duration of a single day,<a class="noteRef" id="n301.2src" href="#n301.2">33</a> a requisite which is obeyed by Bhavabhūti in his <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> and by Rājaçekhara in his <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> despite the difficulties presented by the effort thus to condense the epic. But it
is essential that the events described shall not be disconnected; they must flow from
the same cause, or issue naturally from one another. There should be an effective
development of the plot within the Act; at the time when it comes to an end by the
departure of the actors—three or four at most, one of whom should be the hero—at the
moment when they seemed to have attained their immediate aims, a new motive should
come into play, and a fresh impetus be given to the movement of the drama. But it
is neither necessary nor usual that Act should follow Act without interval; on the
contrary, anything up to a year may intervene between the action of one Act and that
of the next; if the events as recorded in history covered more than that time, as
in the case of Rāma’s fourteen years of banishment in the forest, the poet must reduce
the period to a year or less. To reveal to the audience the events during such intervals
the theory permits a choice of five forms of scenes of introduction (<i>arthopakṣepaka</i>), which serve also to narrate things, whose performance on the stage is forbidden
by the etiquette of the drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n301.3src" href="#n301.3">34</a>
</p>
<p>Two of these are the Viṣkambha or Viṣkambhaka and the Praveçaka, which are both explanatory
scenes, but between which the theory draws fine distinctions. The Viṣkambhaka is performed
by not more than two persons,<a class="noteRef" id="n301.4src" href="#n301.4">35</a> never of chief rank; it serves to explain the past or the future, and it may be used
at the beginning of a drama where it is not desired to arouse sentiment at the outset.
It is pure (<i>çuddha</i>) if the performers are of <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>middle rank and speak Sanskrit; mixed (<i>saṁkīrṇa</i>) when the characters are of middle and inferior class and use also Prākrit. The Praveçaka
cannot be used at the beginning of a drama, and is confined to inferior characters,
who use Prākrit. Thus in the <i>Çakuntalā</i> Act III is introduced by a Viṣkambhaka, in which a young disciple of the sage Kaṇva
tells us in Sanskrit of the king’s stay at the hermitage, while in Act VI a Praveçaka
gives the episode of the fisherman and the police. An abbreviated mode of producing
the same result is the Cūlikā,<a class="noteRef" id="n302.1src" href="#n302.1">36</a> in which a voice from behind the curtain narrates some essential event, as when in
Act IV of the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> we learn thus of the defeat of Paraçurāma by Rāma. In the An̄kamukha, or anticipatory
scene, at the close of one Act a character alludes to the subject of the following
Act; thus at the end of Act II in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> Sumantra announces the arrival of Vasiṣṭha, Viçvāmitra, and Paraçurāma, and these
three open Act III. A different view is taken by Viçvanātha, who makes it out to be
a part of an Act in which allusion is made to the subject-matter of the following
Acts and the whole plot, as is done in the dialogue of Avalokitā and Kāmandakī in
Act I of the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>. This is evidently an attempt to justify the treatment of this form of scene as revealing
matters which cannot conveniently be depicted on the stage, as well as to distinguish
it from the An̄kāvatāra or continuation scene, in which the action is continued by
the characters in the next Act without any break, other than the technical one of
the departure of the actors and their return, as at the close of Act I of the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>. Such a scene obviously in no way answers the purpose of explanation, and its assignment
to such an end is clearly erroneous.
</p>
<p>Various devices are recognized to help the movement of the intrigue, five of which
are classed as internal junctures (<i>antarasandhi</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n302.2src" href="#n302.2">37</a> The first of these is the dream, as in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i> where Bhānumatī is terrified by a vision in which she sees an ichneumon (<i>nakula</i>) slay a hundred snakes, dread presage of the fall of the hundred Kauravas before
the attack of Nakula and his <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>brothers. The letter serves in the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, Act III, to allow the heroine to express her feelings towards the king; she reads
it aloud and he overhears it and breaks in upon her; more often it serves the important
end of conveying news, leading to dramatic action. A message serves the same end,
as when in the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, Act VI, Mātali brings to the king Indra’s message imploring aid against the demons.
A voice from behind the scene (<i>nepathyokti</i>) in Act I of that play warns Duḥṣanta not to kill the gazelle of the hermitage, and
a voice in the air (<i>ākāçabhāṣita</i>) in Act IV makes known to Kaṇva on his return the important news of Çakuntalā’s marriage
and approaching motherhood. The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n303.1src" href="#n303.1">38</a> ignores the term internal junctures, but has the term special junctures or divisions
of junctures (<i>sandhyantara</i>) which includes the dream, the letter, and the message, among many other miscellaneous
elements; two of these are akin to those already mentioned. The picture is used in
the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> as the mode by which the heroine satisfies her longing for her beloved, while Vāsavadattā
discovers Vatsa’s infidelity through seeing the portrait of Sāgarikā, painted beside
that of the king by the mischievous Susaṁgatā. Intoxication (<i>mada</i>) may result as in the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>, Act III, in the letting fall of imprudent words by an important character. Other
devices might have been included in the list, such as that of assuming a disguise
on the stage, a device used by Harṣa in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> and the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> in order to secure the inconstant king uninterrupted interviews with the objects
of his temporary affections. The latter play contains in Act III a good example of
the embryo Act (<i>garbhān̄ka</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="n303.2src" href="#n303.2">39</a> which is recognized by the theory but not classed as a species of juncture; in it
Vāsavadattā causes her maids of honour to perform before her a play representing her
early adventures with Vatsa. So in the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> Vālmīki has performed by the Apsarases before Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa the adventures of
Sītā since her banishment, and the events of her marriage are described in this form
in the <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i>, Act III.
</p>
<p>Similarly the theory recognizes as a separate element the pro-episode (<i>patākāsthānaka</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="n303.3src" href="#n303.3">40</a> an equivocal speech or situation which <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>foreshadows an event whether near at hand or distant. The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> distinguishes four kinds of equivoke. An ambiguous situation may result in bringing
about the aim of the hero; thus in Act III of the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, when Vatsa hastens to save Vāsavadattā, as he thinks, from hanging herself, he finds
to his equal joy and surprise that he has rescued none other than Sāgarikā herself.<a class="noteRef" id="n304.1src" href="#n304.1">41</a> Or the equivocation may lie in words, whose sense the spectator alone grasps in its
deeper application; thus in Act II of the <i>Çakuntalā</i> a voice behind the scene bids the female Cakravāka say farewell to her spouse, a
command whose application to the case of the king and the heroine is immediately appreciated
by the audience alone. Or the equivocation may be deliberately conveyed in the response
of the actor, whose words apply not merely to the immediate matter in hand, but allude
to the future; in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i>, Act II, Duryodhana is told of the mishap of the breaking of his standard by the
fierce (<i>bhīma</i>) wind in words which presage his own fall, his thigh broken by Bhīma’s blow. Finally
we may have a <i>double entendre</i> which later is destined to find a third application; in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> Vatsa playfully suggests that his earnest gaze on the creeper, which has borne blossoms
out of season, may cause jealousy in the queen; his words apply equally to a maiden,
and in the sequel the queen is made furiously angry by his ardent gaze at Sāgarikā.
The <i>Daçarūpa</i> contents itself with two species, equivocation of situation and deliberate equivocation
of phrase, but there is general agreement that pro-episodes may be used in any part
of the play and not merely in the first four junctures.
</p>
<p>Importance attaches to the conventions which enable the author to surmount difficulties
inseparable from the dramatic form.<a class="noteRef" id="n304.2src" href="#n304.2">42</a> Normally, of course, the actors speak aloud (<i>prakāçam</i>), to be heard by all those on the stage as well as by the audience, but asides (<i>svagatam</i>, <i>ātmagatam</i>) are frequent, meant to be heard by the audience alone. If the need arises for making
a remark to be heard by one actor only, it is made in the form of a confidence (<i>apavāritam</i>, <i>apavārya</i>), while a private conversation (<i>janāntikam</i>) is arranged by the actors holding up three <span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>fingers, the thumb and ring finger being curved inwards. Or, it is possible to avoid
bringing on a person by speaking in the air (<i>ākāçabhāṣita</i>), pretending to hear the reply, and repeating it before answering it, while a similar
purpose can be served by a voice from behind the scene.
</p>
<p>The number of Acts which a play should contain varies according to the nature of the
drama; in the Nāṭaka the number must be at least five, and may be ten; in other cases
one Act suffices. Normally the Acts are simply numbered; in some cases, as in that
of the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, names are given, doubtless not by the poet.

<p class="first">The hero owes his name, Nāyaka, to the fact that it is he who leads (<i>nī</i>) the events to the conclusion which he has set before him, in so far as such a result
is permitted by human frailty and the force of circumstances. His good qualities are
innumerable<a class="noteRef" id="n305.1src" href="#n305.1">43</a>; he must be modest as is Rāma in depreciating his own prowess in comparison with
that of Paraçurāma whom he has vanquished; handsome, generous like Jīmūtavāhana, prompt
and skilled in action, affable, beloved of his people, of high family, ready of speech,
and steadfast. He must be young, and endowed with intelligence, energy, a good memory,
skill in the arts, and just pride; a hero, firm, glorious, skilled in the sciences,
and an observer of law. More useful is the distinction drawn between types of hero<a class="noteRef" id="n305.2src" href="#n305.2">44</a>; all are noble or self-controlled (<i>dhīra</i>), a characteristic not universally found in heroines, but they are distinguished
as light-hearted or gay (<i>lalita</i>), calm (<i>çānta</i>) exalted (<i>udātta</i>), and haughty or vehement (<i>uddhata</i>).
</p>
<p>The light-hearted hero is one free from care, a lover of the arts, and above all a
devotee of love; he is normally a king whose public burdens are confided to others,
and whose one business it is to secure union with a new favourite by overcoming the
obstacles interposed by the not unnatural jealousy of his queen or queens; such beyond
all is Vatsa in Bhāsa and Harṣa’s dramas. The calm hero differs primarily from the
light-hearted hero by reason of his birth, for he is a Brahmin or merchant, such <span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>as Mādhava in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> and Cārudatta in the <i>Daridracārudatta</i> and the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>; the hero of the Prakaraṇa, or comedy of manners, normally is of this class. The
exalted hero is a character of great strength and nobility, firm of purpose, but free
from vanity, forbearing, and without egotism. Of such a type are generals, ministers
and high officials, and Jīmūtavāhana in the <i>Nāgānanda</i>. An instructive controversy rages round this description of Jīmūtavāhana; to be exalted,
it is argued, implies the desire of superiority, but Jīmūtavāhana renounces every
dream of empire and is a model of calm, of boundless pity, and freedom from passion
save, indeed, as regards his love for Malayavatī, which is inconsistent with the general
nature of his character. He should really be ranked among the calm heroes, with the
Buddha himself, disregarding the meaningless convention which excludes kings from
that category. Dhanika<a class="noteRef" id="n306.1src" href="#n306.1">45</a> effectively defends the classification of Jīmūtavāhana by insisting that he is not
without desire, namely that of saving others at the cost of his own life; the desires
he lays aside are wishes for personal advantage which Kālidāsa rightly censures in
a king; his love for Malayavatī is wholly inconsistent with calmness, which, on the
contrary, is in fact as in drama a characteristic of Brahmins, and it distinguishes
him absolutely from the Buddha, who is exempt from passion. The haughty hero is a
victim of pride and jealousy, an adept in magic arts and ruses, self-assertive, fickle,
irascible, and boastful; Paraçurāma illustrates this character.
</p>
<p>The chief hero in any drama must be essentially true to one or other of those types;
any change would spoil the unity of the development of the drama, and, if necessary,
changes must be made in the plot, as in the case of Rāma’s dealings with Vālin, to
preserve the unity of character. In the case of the secondary hero there is no need
for such consistency; he may change in different situations, and his lack of consistency
tends merely to heighten the impression caused by the constancy of the hero. Thus
Paraçurāma appears in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i><a class="noteRef" id="n306.2src" href="#n306.2">46</a> as exalted in his attitude to the evil Rāvaṇa, as haughty towards the untried Rāma,
and as calm when he has experienced the superior prowess of that hero. It is obvious
that there is difficulty in conceiving as a chief hero <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>one of the haughty type, and the theory does not provide us with one, for Paraçurāma
is only a secondary hero.
</p>
<p>As the Sanskrit drama deals usually with love, the theory has another division of
types of hero based on their attitude to women.<a class="noteRef" id="n307.1src" href="#n307.1">47</a> The courteous (<i>dakṣiṇa</i>) hero is one who can find room in his heart for more loves than one; he seeks another
to the deep grief of the old, but he does not cease to feel affection for his earlier
love; such are the heroes of the Nāṭikā, or short heroic comedy, like Vatsa. He may
not be regarded as either deceitful (<i>çaṭha</i>), or shameless (<i>dhṛṣṭa</i>), for these two types represent heroes who have ceased to love their former flame,
and differ only in so far as they seek to deceive her, or are indifferent to her anger
and bear open traces of the new attachment. Men like Vatsa never allow passion to
dominate them; if a woman spurns them they are ready to leave her. The fourth type
is the loyal (<i>anukūla</i>) lover who is faithful to one woman only, as is Rāma. As these four types are applicable
to each class of hero, there are sixteen possible kinds of hero, and the theory adds
the further complication that each of these may be a high class, middle class, or
inferior person, giving forty-eight types.
</p>
<p>As if the enumeration of the general characteristics of the hero were insufficient,
a set of eight special excellencies<a class="noteRef" id="n307.2src" href="#n307.2">48</a> is enumerated separately as springing from his character (<i>sāttvika</i>). These are brilliance (<i>çobhā</i>), including compassion for inferiors, emulation with superiors, heroism, and cleverness;
vivacity (<i>vilāsa</i>), including a firm step and glance and a laughing voice; grace (<i>mādhurya</i>) manifested in the display of but slight change of demeanour in trying circumstances;
impassivity (<i>gāmbhīrya</i>) or superiority to emotion; steadfastness (<i>sthairya</i>) in accomplishing his object despite obstacles; the sense of honour (<i>tejas</i>) which will punish insult even at the cost of life itself; lightheartedness as grace
of deportment; and nobility (<i>audārya</i>) exhibited in sacrifice for the sake of the good.
</p>
<p>The enemy of the hero (<i>pratināyaka</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n307.3src" href="#n307.3">49</a> is self-controlled and vehement (<i>dhīroddhata</i>); but he is also avaricious, stubborn, criminal, and vicious; such are Rāvaṇa and
Duryodhana as contrasted <span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>with Rāma and Yudhiṣṭhira. On the other hand, the hero of the episode, the companion
(<i>pīṭhamarda</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n308.1src" href="#n308.1">50</a> of the hero, is to possess, but in a less degree, the qualities of the hero; he is
to be intelligent, ever in attendance on the hero, and devoted to his interests, as
are Makaranda in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> and Sugrīva in the dramas based on the Rāma legend. The term, however, is unknown
to these plays, while in the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> the nun Kauçikī is styled a Pīṭhamardikā, and serves as a trusted go-between. The
theory here seems to have stereotyped a relationship commoner in an older type of
drama.
</p>
<p>The heroine, Nāyikā,<a class="noteRef" id="n308.2src" href="#n308.2">51</a> plays a part in the economy of the drama similar to that of the hero, and not of
less importance. The types of heroine depend primarily on her relation to the hero;
she may be his wife (<i>svā</i>, <i>svīyā</i>) or belong to another (<i>anyā</i>, <i>anyastrī</i>) or be a hetaera. The hero’s wife must be upright and of good character, but she
may be inexperienced (<i>mugdhā</i>), partly experienced (<i>madhyā</i>), or fully experienced and bold (<i>pragalbhā</i>). The inexperienced wife is shy in her love and gentle in her anger with her spouse’s
infidelities. The partly experienced is full of the love of youth, and even faints
in her passion; when angry, if self-controlled, she chides her husband with <i>double entendres</i>; if but partly controlled, she allows her tears to aid her reproaches; if uncontrolled,
she adds harsh words. The bold wife is frantically in love, fainting at the first
embrace; when angry, if self-controlled, she adopts an attitude of haughty reserve
and indifference to the pleasures of life; if lacking in self-control, she uses threats
and blows; if partly self-controlled, she employs the weapons of raillery and <span class="corr" id="xd32e11875" title="Source: equivoque">equivoke</span>. A further division is possible, for each of these three kinds of heroine may be
subdivided according as the lady is the earlier or later of the loves of the husband.
</p>
<p>A woman, who is in the power of another, may be the wife of another man or a maiden.
An amour with a married woman may not form the subject of the dominant sentiment in
the play, but that for a maiden may occur as an element in the principal or the secondary
action. Even when a parent or guardian is willing to permit a maiden’s marriage, there
may be other obstacles, as in the case of the love of Mālatī and Mādhava and <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>in Vatsa’s numerous amours. The woman who is common to all (<i>sādhāraṇī</i>) is a courtesan, skilled in the arts, bold, and cunning; she accepts as lovers the
rich, the foolish, the self-willed, the selfish, and the impotent so long as their
money lasts, then she has them turned out of doors by her mother, who acts as go-between.
If she is a heroine, she must be represented as in love, like Vasantasenā in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, except in a Prahasana or farce, where she can be depicted as fleecing her lovers
for comic effect; she must not figure as a heroine if the hero is divine or royal.
</p>
<p>The heroine may occupy eight different relations to her lover.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.1src" href="#n309.1">52</a> She may be his absolute mistress (<i>svādhīnapatikā</i>) and he her obedient slave; she may be awaiting him in full dress (<i>vāsakasajjā</i>); she may be distressed by his involuntary absence (<i>virahotkaṇṭhitā</i>), enraged (<i>khaṇḍitā</i>) at discovering him disfigured by the marks of her rival’s teeth and nails, or be
severed from her beloved by a quarrel (<i>kalahāntaritā</i>) and suffer remorse, or be deceived (<i>vipralabdhā</i>) by a lover who fails to meet her at the rendezvous which she has named. Her lover
may be absent abroad (<i>proṣitapriyā</i>), or she may have to seek him out or press him to come to her (<i>abhisārikā</i>), giving as meeting-place a ruined temple, a garden, the house of a go-between, a
cemetery, the bank of a stream, or in general any dark place. The first two classes
of heroine are bright and gay, the others are wearied, tearful, changing colour, sighing,
and wear no ornaments as token of their dejection. A woman, who is subject to another,
cannot stand in all these relations to a lover; she may be distressed at his absence,
deceived, or driven to seek him out, but she cannot be enraged, for she is not the
mistress of her lover, and thus the king’s courtesy to Mālavikā in Kālidāsa’s play
is not to be treated as an effort to appease an enraged heroine.
</p>
<p>The heroine is accorded even a more generous allowance of excellencies than the hero.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.2src" href="#n309.2">53</a> The first three are physical, the first display of emotion in a nature previously
exempt (<i>bhāva</i>), the movement of eyes and brows betokening the awakening of love (<i>hāva</i>), and the still more open manifestation of affection. The next seven are inherent
characteristics of the heroine; the brilliance of youth and passion; the added touch
of loveliness <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>given by love, sweetness, radiance, courage, dignity, and self-control. Then come
ten graces; the sportive imitation of the movements or words of the beloved one, the
swift change of aspect at his arrival, tasteful arrangement of one’s ornaments to
increase radiance of appearance, studied confusion of ornaments, hysteria (<i>kilakiñcita</i>), in which anger, fear, joy, and tears mingle, manifestations of affection (<i>moṭṭāyita</i>) on hearing the beloved mentioned or seeing his portrait, pretended anger (<i>kuṭṭamita</i>) on the lover touching hair or lip, affected indifference (<i>bibboka</i>), born of excess of pride, a graceful pose (<i>lalita</i>), and the bashfulness which forbids speech even when an opportunity presents itself.
To these twenty Viçvanātha adds eight more graces; the pride which is vain of youth
and beauty, the ennui which besets the maiden in her lover’s absence, the <i>naïveté</i> which displays itself in pretended ignorance and innocence, the distraction evinced
by ornaments in disorder, wandering glances, and truant words, curiosity, the meaningless
laugh of youth and high spirits, the tremors of fear causeless but common in the presence
of the lover, and the sportive play of young affection. The same source gives us in
great detail the modes in which the different types of heroine display their affection,
in maidenly modesty or in shameless boldness, an analysis showing keen and deep insight
into all the outward manifestations of love at an Indian court. Less praiseworthy
is the perverse ingenuity which enumerates the different types of heroine, and educes
first 128 from the combination of the eight forms of relationship to the lover with
the sixteen kinds based on the division of wife, another’s, and hetaera. These are
then multiplied by three on the basis of the division of all characters as high class,
middle class, and low class.
</p>
<p>The same division of classes is applied to all the other characters (<i>pātra</i>) which can appear in a play, but a much more fundamental classification is that by
sex, masculine, feminine, and neuter. Most of the rôles are such as are incidental
to the life of a palace, for the normal drama deals with the amours of a king, and
his entourage and that of the queen account for practically all the normal characters
of the drama.
</p>
<p>The king’s confidant and devoted friend is the Vidūṣaka,<a class="noteRef" id="n310.1src" href="#n310.1">54</a> a Brahmin, ludicrous alike in dress, speech, and behaviour. He is a <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>misshapen dwarf, baldheaded, with projecting teeth and red eyes, who makes himself
ridiculous by his silly chatter in Prākrit, and his greed for food and presents of
every kind. It is a regular part of the play for the other characters to make fun
of him, but he is always by the king’s side, and the latter makes him his confidant
in all his affairs of the heart, while the Vidūṣaka repays him by willing, if frequently
incompetent or unlucky, attempts at service. The theorists offer no explanation of
the anomaly of a Brahmin in such a curious position, but Açvaghoṣa already has the
figure, as has Bhāsa, though not in his epic dramas, and later he is established as
almost an essential feature in all dramas not derived from the epic; the chief exception
is the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>, where, however, his place is taken by the hero’s friend in sport (<i>narmasuhṛd</i>).
</p>
<p>A much less common, but an interesting character is that of the Viṭa,<a class="noteRef" id="n311.1src" href="#n311.1">55</a> who resembles, though distantly, the parasite of the Greek drama; he is a poet skilled
in the arts, especially music, acquainted <i>au fond</i> with the ways of hetaerae, in short a perfect man of the world with literary and
artistic culture to boot. He is an essential figure in the Bhāṇa, or monologue, in
which he relates his own shady adventures, but in other forms of drama he plays but
a small part; Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti ignore him, and, while Harṣa depicts him in
the <i>Nāgānanda</i>, his position there is episodic; in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> alone does he attain full development in his relation to the boastful Çakāra. Both
these figures appear also in the <i>Cārudatta</i>, Çūdraka’s model. The Çakāra,<a class="noteRef" id="n311.2src" href="#n311.2">56</a> brother of a royal concubine, is of low caste, easily angered and appeased, fond
of fine raiment, and proud of his office, in which, however, he shows himself corrupt
and incompetent. He is found also in an episode of the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, but then fades from the drama leaving, however, a clear suggestion of its early
history.
</p>
<p>The king requires in his amours the aid of a messenger (<i>dūta</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n311.3src" href="#n311.3">57</a> as well as for more serious affairs. The holder of this rôle must be possessed of
loyalty, energy, courage, a good memory, and adroitness; he may be given full powers
to act as seems best in each emergency, or have limited authority, or be a mere bearer
<span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>of a message. Others intimately associated with the royal household are the servants
(<i>ceṭa</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="n312.1src" href="#n312.1">58</a> the mercenaries, Kirātas or Mlecchas, the chaplain, priest, and other theologians.
There are also those employed in the government of the realm, which the king is only
too pleased to neglect.<a class="noteRef" id="n312.2src" href="#n312.2">59</a> The minister (<i>mantrin</i>, <i>amātya</i>) is of good family, of high intelligence, skilled in affairs human and divine, and
devoted to the interests of the country. The general (<i>senāpati</i>) is also of high birth, incapable of weakness, skilled in both the theory and the
practice of war, and kind of speech; ready to note the weakness of the enemy and to
direct at the suitable moment a campaign against him. The judge (<i>prāḍvivāka</i>) must be master of the laws and of judicial procedure, absolutely impartial, devoted
to his duty, free from anger or pride, master of himself. The other officers are required
to possess high qualities of intelligence, activity, and devotion to duty, while for
less important work the king commands the services of foresters, military officers,
and soldiers. The prince royal (<i>kumāra</i>) and the friend are also mentioned in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, but without detail.
</p>
<p>Of women’s rôles<a class="noteRef" id="n312.3src" href="#n312.3">60</a> the most important in dignity is that of the chief queen (<i>mahādevī</i>), the equal in age and rank of her husband, whose lapses in affection wound her,
without robbing her of her sense of self-respect or dignity. In good fortune or evil
she is devoted to him and seeks ever his welfare. The queen (<i>devī</i>) is also a daughter of a king, but she is more proud than dignified, and, intoxicated
by her youth and beauty, her mind is set on the pleasures of love. The favourite (<i>svāminī</i>) is the daughter of a general or a minister, seductive by her beauty and intelligence,
honoured by the king and others. There are other types of concubine (<i>sthāyinī</i> and <i>bhoginī</i>) with characteristics but little distinctive. The harem includes also the chief attendants
(<i>āyukta</i>), who are charged with the supreme oversight of some department of the court, the
king’s personal attendant who is always with him (<i>anucārikā</i>), the maid who performs his toilet and holds over him the umbrella of state, the
women—called sometimes Yavanīs, once Greek maidens—who act as his body-guard, and
those aged women who are skilled in political traditions <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>and are respected on that score. There are also the princess, <i>ingénue</i> and modest, and the duenna (<i>mahattarā</i>), who among other things sees to the punctual performance of auspicious rites, and
the more humble adepts in the dance, in song, in handicrafts, in acting, and in the
favourite amusement of swinging the ladies of the harem. The hetaera is painted in
attractive colours; she is thoroughly well educated, exempt from the normal defects
of women, kind of heart, adroit, active, a born coquette, and seductive in every way.
Special importance among these feminine rôles attaches to that of the heroine’s messenger,
the counterpart of the hero’s agent. She may be a friend, a slave, a foster-sister,
a neighbour, a workwoman, or an artiste, or strangely enough, a nun, usually of Buddhist
connexions, a curious and interesting sidelight on Indian views of the devotees of
that faith. The doorkeeper (<i>pratīhārī</i>) has the function of announcing to the king such political events as the declaration
of war and the conclusion of peace.
</p>
<p>The neuter rôles<a class="noteRef" id="n313.1src" href="#n313.1">61</a> are filled by men who have either taken vows of chastity, or have been deprived of
virility in order to permit of their employment in the harem. The Snātaka is a Brahmin,
who has completed his course of religious study, is familiar with religious and social
affairs; he resides within the palace. The chamberlain (<i>kañcukin</i>) is an old Brahmin, worn out in the service of the king, but still mentally alert
and skilled in his business of conveying the royal orders in the palace. The eunuchs
(<i>varṣadhara</i>, <i>nirmuṇḍa</i>, <i>upasthāyika</i>) are effeminate and cowardly but not lacking in <i>savoir faire</i>; they find employment in the king’s amours.
</p>
<p>The nomenclature<a class="noteRef" id="n313.2src" href="#n313.2">62</a> of the characters is in some measure regulated by rule; the name of a hetaera should
end in <i>dattā</i>, <i>senā</i>, or <i>siddhā</i>, as does that of Vasantasenā in the <i>Cārudatta</i>; that of a merchant in <i>datta</i> as in Cārudatta; that of the Vidūṣaka from spring or a flower, but in the <i>Avimāraka</i> he is styled Saṁtuṣṭa; that of a servant, male or female, should be derived from
some object, which occurs in descriptions of the seasons, &amp;c., as in the names Kalahaṅsa
and Mandārikā in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>; those of Kāpālikas, a species of ascetics, should end in <i>ghaṇṭa</i> as in Aghoraghaṇṭa in the same play.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is also an elaborate etiquette<a class="noteRef" id="n314.1src" href="#n314.1">63</a> as to the mode of addressing the diverse personages. A king is styled thus by ascetics,
but Deva or Svāmin by his courtiers; his charioteer and Brahmins generally hail him
as Āyuṣmant<span class="corr" id="xd32e12078" title="Not in source">,</span> ‘long-lived’, while inferiors style him Bhaṭṭa, ‘master’. The crown prince is styled
Svāmin, like his father; the other princes of the blood (<i>bhartṛdāraka</i>), but also common people, Bhadramukha or Saumya, preceded by <i>he</i> in the latter case, terms designed to conciliate by attributing to those addressed
the qualities they are desired to show.<a class="noteRef" id="n314.2src" href="#n314.2">64</a> The style Bhagavant, ‘blessed’, is appropriate to the gods, to great sages and saints;
Ārya, ‘noble’, is appropriate to Brahmins, ministers, and elder brothers, while a
wife should address her husband as Āryaputra. Sages address an ascetic as Sādhu; ministers
are styled Amātya or Saciva; the king calls his Vidūṣaka, and is called by him, Vayasya,
‘friend’. Sugṛhītābhidha, ‘well named one’, is the address<a class="noteRef" id="n314.3src" href="#n314.3">65</a> of a pupil to his master, a son to a father, or a younger to an elder brother, while
the latter in return uses Tāta or Vatsa, both affectionate and condescending terms,
suitable also for use to a son, or any person who owes one respect. Heretics should
be given the styles they affect, thus a Buddhist should be hailed as Bhadanta; Çakas
should be styled by such terms as Bhadradatta. The interjection Haṅho may be used
between men of middle rank, Haṇḍe between common people. The Vidūṣaka addresses the
queen and her ladies as Bhavatī; otherwise the queen is styled Bhaṭṭinī or Svāminī,
a wife as Āryā, a princess Bhartṛdārikā, a hetaera Ajjukā, a go-between or aged dame
Ambā; Halā is used between friends of equal rank, Hañjā is addressed to a servant.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> <i>The Sentiments</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most original and interesting part of dramatic theory is the gradual definition
of the nature of the sentiment which it is the aim of the performance to evoke in
the mind of the audience.<a class="noteRef" id="n314.4src" href="#n314.4">66</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>The statement of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> is simple. Sentiment is produced from the union of the determinants (<i>vibhāva</i>), the consequents (<i>anubhāva</i>), and the transitory feelings (<i>vyabhicārin</i>). The determinants fall in the later classification into two divisions, the fundamental
determinants (<i>ālambana</i>) and the excitant determinants (<i>uddīpana</i>); fundamental determinants comprise such things as the heroine or the hero, for without
them there can be no creation of sentiment in the audience; excitant determinants
are such conditions of place and time and circumstance as serve to foster sentiment
when it has arisen, for instance the moon, the cry of the cuckoo, the soft breeze
from Malaya, all things which foster the erotic sentiment. The consequents are the
external manifestations of feeling, by which the actors exhibit to the audience the
minds and hearts of the persons of the drama, such as sidelong glances, a smile, a
movement of the arm, and—though this is but slightly indicated in later texts—his
words.<a class="noteRef" id="n315.1src" href="#n315.1">67</a> A special class is later made of those consequents, which are the involuntary product
of sympathetic realization of the feeling of the person portrayed, and hence are called
Sāttvika, as arising from a heart which is ready to appreciate the sorrows or joys
of another (<i>sattva</i>); these are paralysis, fainting, horripilation, perspiration, change of colour, trembling,
weeping, and change of voice. The transitory or evanescent feelings are given as thirty-three;
they are discouragement, weakness, apprehension, weariness, contentment, stupor, joy,
depression, cruelty, anxiety, fright, envy, indignation, arrogance, recollection,
death, intoxication, dreaming, sleeping, awakening, shame, epilepsy, distraction,
assurance, indolence, agitation, deliberation, dissimulation, sickness, insanity,
despair, impatience, and inconstancy. But these factors are not sufficient to account
for sentiment, nor does the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e12147" title="Source: Nātyaçāstra">Nāṭyaçāstra</span></i> intend this. It recognizes that an essential element in the production of sentiment
is the dominant emotion (<i>sthāyibhāva</i>) which persists throughout the drama amid the variations of the transitory feelings;
it stands to the other factors in the position of the king to his subjects or a master
to his pupils, as the Çāstra says; it is, says the <i>Daçarūpa</i>, the source of delight, and brings into harmony with itself the transitory states
of feeling.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is the dominant emotions which in some fashion determine or become sentiments even
in the view of the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e12159" title="Source: Nāṭyaçastra">Nāṭyaçāstra</span></i>, though in it there is clearly difficulty in conceiving the precise signification
of the process, a fact revealed in a tendency to confuse the terms emotion and sentiment,
Bhāva and Rasa. In Bhaṭṭa Lollaṭa<a class="noteRef" id="n316.1src" href="#n316.1">68</a> we have a determined effort to make clear the implication of the doctrine. The dominant
emotion of love, for instance, generated by a fundamental determinant such as a maiden,
inflamed by an excitant determinant such as a pleasant garden, made cognizable by
consequents such as sidelong glances and embraces, and strengthened by transitory
feelings such as desire, becomes the erotic sentiment first of all in the hero of
the drama, e.g. Rāma. The sentiment is subsequently attributed to the actor who imitates
the hero in form, dress, and action, and so it becomes the source of charm to the
audience. The fatal objection to this theory is clear; it fails to recognize that
the sentiment must be that of the spectator himself; he cannot have enjoyment of a
sentiment which exists merely in the actor as a secondary outcome of its existence
in Rāma. Moreover, the actor whose chief aim is to please the audience and earn money
need not feel at all the emotions of Rāma, while, if he does so, he is then in the
same position as a spectator.
</p>
<p>The view of Lollaṭa, which is classed as one of the production (<i>utpatti</i>) of sentiment and regarded as that of the Mīmāṅsā school, is opposed by the doctrine
of Çrīçan̄kuka, regarded as the Naiyāyika view, which interprets the manifestation
of sentiment as a process of inference. The emotions, love, &amp;c., are inferred to exist
in the actor, though not really present in him, by means of the determinants, &amp;c.,
cleverly exhibited in his acting; the emotion thus inferred, being sensed by the audience,
through its exquisite beauty, adds to itself a peculiar charm and thus finally develops
into the state of a sentiment in the spectator. This view, however, is open to the
fatal objection that it is commonly admitted that it is not inference, or any other
derivative mode of knowledge, which produces charm, but perception alone, and no adequate
ground exists for disregarding this general truth in this case.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka<a class="noteRef" id="n317.1src" href="#n317.1">69</a> we find yet a different point of view, which denies either the production (<i>utpatti</i>) of sentiment, its perception or apprehension (<i>pratīti</i>) or its revelation (<i>abhivyakti</i>). If sentiment is perceived as appertaining to another, then it cannot personally
affect oneself. But it cannot be perceived as present in oneself as a result of study
of a work about Rāma; there are no factors present in the self to produce any such
result; it is impossible to hold that an emotion dormant in oneself is called to life
by seeing or reading the story of Rāma; experience shows that one’s own beloved does
not come up to one’s mind to raise love, nor could a tale of a goddess evoke the picture
of a mortal amour; again, such marvellous deeds as Rāma’s have nothing common to mortal
efforts so as to be able to awake conceptions of acts of our own. Thus sentiment cannot
be apprehended. Nor is it a case of production; if so, no one would go twice to a
play of a pathetic type, since one would experience actual misery as the result, in
lieu of a pleasant melancholy; again the sight of lovers united does not in real life
produce sentiment. Nor is a case of the revelation of something existing potentially
(<i>çaktirūpa</i>). If this were so, then, when the potential emotions were let loose, they would occupy
their field of action in diverse degrees—thus contradicting the nature of sentiment
as one; moreover there would be the same difficulties as in the case of apprehension
as to whether revelation applied to the hero or oneself. The true solution, therefore,
is to ascribe to a poem a peculiar threefold potency of its own, the power of denotation
(<i>abhidhā</i>), which deals with what is expressed, the power of realization (<i>bhāvakatva</i>), which relates to the sentiment, and the power of enjoyment (<i>bhojakatva</i>), which has regard to the audience. If denotation were all, there would be no difference
between poetic figures and manuals, there would be absence of the distinctions produced
by divergence of literal and metaphorical sense, and the avoidance of harsh sounds
would be needless. As it is, we have the second function of realization of sentiment,
which causes the expressed sense to serve as the basis of the sentiment, and confers
on the determinants, &amp;c., the essential feature of being appropriated by the audience
as universal. From this comes the appreciation by the audience <span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>of the sentiment, an appreciation consisting in a mental condition made up entirely
of the element of goodness or truth (<i>sattva</i>), uninfluenced by the other elements of passion (<i>rajas</i>) and dullness (<i>tamas</i>), that is, entirely free from desire, comparable with meditation on the absolute.
This condition is the vital element; the enjoyment ranks above the aesthetic equipment<a class="noteRef" id="n318.1src" href="#n318.1">70</a> which renders it possible. To this theory which is sometimes ascribed to the Sāṁkhya,<a class="noteRef" id="n318.2src" href="#n318.2">71</a> and called the Bhuktivāda, doctrine of the enjoyment of sentiment, the objection
is made that the two powers ascribed to poetry, realization, and enjoyment, have no
legitimate foundation.
</p>
<p>The view finally adopted by the theorists is that defended, but not first enunciated,
by Abhinavagupta, based on the general doctrine of suggestion (<i>vyañjanā</i>) as lying at the basis of all poetic pleasure. The spectator’s state of mind must
be considered; it is in him that from experience of life there come into being emotional
complexes, which lie dormant, ready to be called into activity by the reading of poems
or by seeing plays performed. Those whose life has left them barren of impressions
of emotions are, accordingly, incapable of relishing dramas, a fate which awaits men
whose minds are intent merely on grammar or on the complexities of the Mīmāṅsā. The
sentiment thus excited is peculiar, in that it is essentially universal in character;
it is common to all other trained spectators, and it has essentially no personal significance.
A sentiment is thus something very different from an ordinary emotion; it is generic
and disinterested, while an emotion is individual and immediately personal. An emotion
again may be pleasant or painful, but a sentiment is marked by that impersonal joy,
characteristic of the contemplation of the supreme being by the adept, a bliss which
is absolutely without personal feeling. There is in fact a close parallel between
the man of taste (<i>sahṛdaya</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n318.3src" href="#n318.3">72</a> and the adept (<i>yogin</i>); both have in them the possibility of attaining this bliss, and, to make it real,
the one must investigate the determinants, &amp;c., while the other must apply himself
to concentration on the absolute. It is <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>this peculiar nature of sentiment which forbids it being created as the result of
denotation or indication by speech, of perception, inference, or recollection. It
cannot exist without determinants, &amp;c., but these are not in the normal sense causes;
an effect can exist when its causes have disappeared, but sentiment exists only while
the determinants, &amp;c., last; the terms used in this regard are one and all distinct
from the normal terminology of causation. Sentiment is something supernatural (<i>alaukika</i>); its relations to the factors may be compared with that of a beverage to the black
pepper, candied sugar, camphor, &amp;c., which compose it, but of which as such no trace
remains in the liquor as produced. This characteristic enables us to understand how
it is that the list of sentiments includes that of horror or odium (<i>bībhatsa</i>) and that of fear (<i>bhayānaka</i>), as well as the pathetic sentiment. These are awakened into life by things which
cause disgust, fear, and grief in ordinary life, and these emotions in real life are
far from pleasant in any sense of that term. But, conveyed as ideal and generic, they
produce this supernatural pleasure or happiness, which is not to be compared with
normal pleasure, just as the joy of the contemplation of the absolute is not to be
described as pleasure in the ordinary sense. Bhānudatta, in his <i>Rasataran̄giṇī</i>, a work composed before <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1437, distinguishes Rāsa as natural (<i>laukika</i>) and supernatural or transcendental; the former is the emotion experienced in ordinary
life—which may more conveniently be distinguished as Bhāva,—the latter includes the
emotion experienced in dream experiences, in the building of castles in the air, and
in the appreciation of poetry, and he is careful to emphasize the totally different
nature of the natural and the transcendental emotion.<a class="noteRef" id="n319.1src" href="#n319.1">73</a>
</p>
<p>The doctrine set out in Abhinavagupta is also that of the <i>Daçarūpa</i>, although it is rendered more obscure there by the brevity of its exposition. The
process of transformation of an emotion to a sentiment is formally described; ‘a dominant
feeling or emotion becomes a sentiment when it is transformed into an object of enjoyment
through the co-operation of the determinants, the consequents, including the involuntary
manifestations of feeling, and the transitory feelings’.<a class="noteRef" id="n319.2src" href="#n319.2">74</a> The sense is made <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>further precise by the assertion<a class="noteRef" id="n320.1src" href="#n320.1">75</a> that the dominant emotion becomes a sentiment, because it is enjoyed by the spectator
of taste, and he is actually at present in existence; the sentiment is not located
in the hero whose actions are represented, for he belongs to the past, nor does it
appertain to the poem, for that is not the object of the poem—its function being to
set out the determinants, &amp;c., through which the dominant emotion is brought out and
generates the sentiment,—nor is sentiment the apprehension by the spectator of the
emotions enacted by the actor, since in that case spectators would feel not sentiment,
but an emotion varying in the different individuals, just as in real life from seeing
a pair in union those who see them feel according to their nature shame, envy, desire,
or aversion. The position of the spectator is compared to that of the child which,
when it plays with its clay elephants—the ancient equivalent of our tin soldiers—experiences
the sensation of its own energy as pleasant; the deeds of Arjuna arouse a like feeling
in the spectator’s mind. This experiencing sentiment is a manifestation of that joy
which is innate as the true nature of the self, and this manifestation comes into
being as the result of the pervasion of the mind of the spectator with the dominant
emotion and the determinants, &amp;c., in combination.
</p>
<p>An effort is made to describe the precise nature of the mental activity involved in
the enjoyment of sentiment, and to base upon it a division of the sentiments. The
four sentiments of love, heroism, horror, and fury are taken as primary, and brought
into connexion with mental conditions described as the unfolding (<i>vikāsa</i>), expansion (<i>vistara</i>), agitation (<i>kṣobha</i>), and movement to and fro (<i>vikṣepa</i>) of the mind.<a class="noteRef" id="n320.2src" href="#n320.2">76</a> These are evidently mental conditions, believed to be reached by introspection, and
they have the merit of giving a quasi-psychological rationale for the doctrine of
four primary and four secondary sentiments found in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n320.3src" href="#n320.3">77</a> But there was no early agreement on this piece of psychology; Abhinavagupta,<a class="noteRef" id="n320.4src" href="#n320.4">78</a> with Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka, accepts only three aspects of mental condition as involved, the
melting (<i>druti</i>), expansion, and unfolding, a division which is applied also in the theory of poetics
to justify the doctrine of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>existence of three qualities only of words.<a class="noteRef" id="n321.1src" href="#n321.1">79</a> On Dhanaṁjaya’s view the sentiment of calm which he denies for drama,<a class="noteRef" id="n321.2src" href="#n321.2">80</a> if it exists at all, must be regarded as combining all the four mental aspects above
distinguished.
</p>
<p>It is now possible to understand clearly the essential relation of the spectator to
the actors; we see on the stage, for instance, Rāma and Sītā, who excites his affection,
aided by suitable circumstances of time and place; this affection is intimated by
speech and gesture alike, which indicate both the dominant emotion of love and its
transient shapes in the various stages of love requited. The spectacle evokes in the
mind of the spectator the impressions of the emotion of love which experience has
planted there, and this ideal and generic excitation of the emotion produces in him
that sense of joy which is known as sentiment. The fullness of the enjoyment depends
essentially on the nature and experience of the spectator, to whom it falls to identify
himself with the hero or other character, and thus to experience in ideal form his
emotions and feelings. He may even succeed in his effort to the extent that he weeps
real tears, feels terror and sorrow, but the sentiment is still one of exquisite joy.
We may compare the thrill of pleasure which the most terrifying narration excites
in us, and we are all conscious of the sweetness of sad tales.
</p>
<p>Viçvanātha insists very strongly on the necessity of the identification of the spectator
with the personages depicted, a process which enables him to accept without any difficulty
such episodes of extraordinary character as Hanumant’s leap over the ocean.<a class="noteRef" id="n321.3src" href="#n321.3">81</a> He must not treat the emotion of love as his own, for in that case it would never
become a sentiment; it would remain a feeling, and in the case of fear, for instance,
it would cause pain, not joy. Nor must he regard it as belonging solely to the hero,
for then it would remain his feeling, and in no wise affect the spectator or become
a sentiment. Similarly, the determinants, &amp;c., are not to be treated as pertaining
to the hero alone; they must be felt as generic. This generic action (<i>sādhāraṇī kṛti</i>) is the essential feature, replacing the generic power which Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka attributes
to poetry. We can now <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>see clearly the position of the actor; the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n322.1src" href="#n322.1">82</a> bids him as far as possible to assume the emotions of the person whom he represents,
and to depict them by costume, speech, movements, and gestures as his own, but Viçvanātha<a class="noteRef" id="n322.2src" href="#n322.2">83</a> is more anxious to insist that the sentiment is not necessarily to be found in the
actor, who often merely performs mechanically his part according to rote and rule;
if he actually does experience the feelings he portrays, then he becomes in so far
a spectator.<a class="noteRef" id="n322.3src" href="#n322.3">84</a> Further, he points out the simultaneous presence of all the factors is by no means
essential, for the existence of one will revive the others by force of the association
of ideas. He insists also on the necessity of experience and cultivation of the power
of imagination in one who seeks to enjoy sentiment; as we are by virtue of the doctrine
of transmigration—or if we prefer to modernize, by heredity—endowed with the germs
of the capacity of appreciation, we can normally by study of poetical works develop
the capacity, but, if we devote ourselves to the study of grammar or philosophy, we
shall certainly deaden our susceptibilities. The difficult problem, why much study
of poetry leaves some still unable to relish the sentiment, is explained by the convenient
hypothesis that demerit in a previous birth intervenes to frustrate present effort.
He refutes at length the effort of Mahiman Bhaṭṭa<a class="noteRef" id="n322.4src" href="#n322.4">85</a> to destroy the whole doctrine of suggestion in poetry by the doctrine of inference;
doubtless by inference we could arrive at a belief in the existence of an emotion
in the hero’s mind but that inference would not produce any effect in us or arouse
sentiment; a logician might make the inference and draw the correct conclusion, but
would remain cold and unmoved. Suggestiveness, he shows, is absolutely essential as
a function of words and as the characteristic of poetry, giving it power to create
sentiment. What is expressed may be understood by every one; the man of taste alone
appreciates the suggestion and enjoys the flavour resulting.
</p>
<p>Now sentiment is one, it is a single, ineffable, transcendental joy, but it can be
subdivided, not according to its own nature, <span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>but according to the emotions which evoke it. Thus the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> recognizes the existence of eight emotions or dominant feelings; love (<i>rati</i>), mirth (<i>hāsa</i>), anger (<i>krodha</i>), sorrow (<i>çoka</i>), energy (<i>utsāha</i>), terror (<i>bhaya</i>), disgust (<i>jugupsā</i>), and astonishment (<i>vismaya</i>), and corresponding to these eight emotions we have eight forms of sentiment. The
erotic sentiment (<i>çṛn̄gārarasa</i>) is of two kinds, the union (<i>sambhoga</i>) or sundering (<i>vipralambha</i>) of two lovers, according to the Çāstra and the great mass of theorists, but the
<i>Daçarūpa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n323.1src" href="#n323.1">86</a> distinguishes three cases, privation (<i>ayoga</i>), sundering (<i>viprayoga</i>), and union. Privation denotes the inability of two young hearts to secure union,
because of obstacles to their marriage; such love passes through ten stages,<a class="noteRef" id="n323.2src" href="#n323.2">87</a> longing, anxiety, recollection, enumeration of the loved one’s merits, distress,
raving, insanity, fever, stupor, and death. Sundering may be due to absence or resentment,
and this in its turn may be caused by a quarrel between two determined lovers, or
indignation at finding out, by sight, hearing or inference, that one’s lover is devoted
to another. The hero may counteract anger by conciliation, by winning over her friends,
by gifts, by humility, by indifference, and by distracting her attention. Absence
again may be due to business, to accident, or a curse; if the reason is death the
love sentiment cannot, in Dhanaṁjaya’s view, be present, though others allow of a
pathetic variety of this sentiment.<a class="noteRef" id="n323.3src" href="#n323.3">88</a> In union the lover should avoid vulgarity or annoyance.
</p>
<p>The heroic (<i>vīra</i>) sentiment corresponds to the emotion of energy; it may take the three forms of courage
in battle as in Rāma; compassion as in Jīmūtavāhana; and liberality as in Paraçurāma.
Assurance, contentment, arrogance, and joy are the transitory states connected with
it. The sentiment of fury (<i>raudra</i>) is based on anger; its transitory states are indignation, intoxication, recollection,
inconstancy, envy, cruelty, agitation, and the like. The comic (<i>hāsya</i>) sentiment depends on mirth, which is caused by one’s own or another’s strange appearance,
speech, or attire.<a class="noteRef" id="n323.4src" href="#n323.4">89</a> The transitory states in connexion with it are <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>sleeping, indolence, weariness, weakness, and stupor. The sentiment of wonder (<i>adbhuta</i>) is based on astonishment; the transitory states are usually joy, agitation, and
contentment. The sentiment of terror (<i>bhayānaka</i>) is based on terror; the states associated with it are depression, agitation, distraction,
fright, and the like. The pathetic (<i>karuṇa</i>) sentiment is based on sorrow; its associated states are sleeping, epilepsy, depression,
sickness, death, indolence, agitation, despair, stupor, insanity, anxiety, and so
forth. The sentiment of horror or odium (<i>bībhatsa</i>) is based on disgust; its associated states are agitation, sickness, apprehension,
and the like. In each case the theorists give in full the determinants and the consequents
of each emotion, which becomes a sentiment, and a special colour is ascribed to each;
it is not surprising to find that red is associated with fury, black with fear; whiteness
may, in association with the comic sentiment, be explained by the flashing teeth of
a laughing maiden, and the dark (<i>çyāma</i>) colour of the erotic sentiment is a reflex of the favoured hue of the beloved; grey
accords with pathos, but the connexion of yellow with wonder, dark blue with horror,
and orange with heroism is not obvious. It is also artificial to find four primary
and four secondary sentiments laid down; the erotic, the furious, the heroic, and
that of horror, whence in order are supposed to develop the comic, the pathetic, that
of wonder and that of terror. The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> recognizes these eight only,<a class="noteRef" id="n324.1src" href="#n324.1">90</a> but later authorities add the sentiment of calm (<i>çānta</i>) based on indifference to worldly things (<i>nirveda</i>), although this is in the Çāstra merely a transitory feeling. Those who follow the
Çāstra contend that there is no such sentiment, for it is impossible to destroy utterly
love, hatred, and other feelings, which have been operative from time without beginning;
others admit the existence of the sentiment, as does Mammaṭa, but not in drama, on
the ground that indifference to all worldly things is incapable of being represented.
But this also is erroneous; the actor’s power of representing indifference is not
in point, as it is the spectator who is to feel the sentiment, and the fact that the
Çāstra places it first in the list of transitory states, though that would normally
be an inauspicious beginning, indicates that it was meant to serve both as an emotion
and a transitory feeling, <span class="pageNum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>and it is fully recognized by Vidyādhara, Viçvanātha, and Jagannātha, though Dhanaṁjaya
barely admits it.<a class="noteRef" id="n325.1src" href="#n325.1">91</a> The interrelations of the sentiments, their possible combinations, their harmonies
and conflicts, are detailed at length.
</p>
<p>The sentiments may all be employed in drama, but there are rules affecting their use.
In each play there should be a dominant sentiment; in the Nāṭaka it should be the
erotic or the heroic; other sentiments are merely auxiliary, but that of wonder is
especially appropriate in the <i>dénouement</i>; indeed something in the way of supernatural intervention is often convenient to
extricate the plot. An excess of sentiments is as bad as a defect; if there are too
many they destroy the unity of the whole and detach it into a series of ill-connected
fragments, while the excessive use of action and of rhetorical display is equally
destructive to the merit of a piece.
</p>
<p>The <i>Çakuntalā</i> illustrates excellently the sentiment of love as the ruling motive of the play; the
heroic sentiment appears in the verses in Act II in which the hermits extol the king;
the horrible in Act VI in the scene in which Mātali menaces the Vidūṣaka; terror is
evoked by the description of the dusk at the close of Act III; the whole play from
the arrival of Kaṇva in Act IV to the departure of Çakuntalā produces the sentiment
of pathos, while that of fury is called into being by the close of Act VI from the
despairing cries of the Vidūṣaka to the entry of Mātali; finally wonder is aroused
by the strange incident at the close when the king picks up the bracelet fallen from
the arm of the child which, unknown to him, is his own son by the wife whom he has
in ignorance repudiated. The Nāṭikās afford excellent examples of the erotic sentiment;
Harṣa, in complete accord with the rules of the drama, helps out his plot in both
the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> and the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> by the use of incidents evoking the sentiment of wonder; the imprisonment of Sāgarikā
in the former play evokes the sentiment of pathos, while terror is excited by the
description in Act II of the wild confusion caused by the monkey’s escape from the
royal mews. The sentiment of fury is frequently evoked in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span><i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i>; the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> affords excellent illustrations evoking horror, while the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> is permeated by the sentiment of heroism. The <i>Nāgānanda</i> reveals heroism in another aspect, that of the perfection of compassion and nobility,
for, as we have seen, Jīmūtavāhana is not to be regarded as a hero in whom calm prevails.
</p>
<p>There is doubtless pedantry in the theory of sentiment; the choice of eight emotions,
the subordination to them of transitory states, the enumeration of determinants and
consequents, are largely dominated by empiricism, and not explained or justified.
But in its essentials the theory may be admitted to be a bold and by no means negligible
attempt to indicate the essential character of the emotional effect of drama.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">6.</span> <i>The Dramatic Styles and Languages</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Plot, characters, and sentiment are not the only constituent elements of drama; the
poet must be an adept in adopting the appropriate manner<a class="noteRef" id="n326.1src" href="#n326.1">92</a> or style (<i>vṛtti</i>), for each action of the hero; the style adds to the play the indefinable element
of perfection which is present in the highest beauty of feature or dress. The manners
allowed by the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> are four, the graceful (<i>kaiçikī</i>), the grand (<i>sāttvatī</i>), the violent (<i>ārabhaṭī</i>), and the verbal (<i>bhāratī</i>), which owes its name to the fact that, unlike the others, it depends for its effect
on words, not action.
</p>
<p>The graceful manner is appropriate to the erotic sentiment; it employs song, dance,
and lovely raiment, admits both male and female rôles, and depicts love, gallantry,
coquetry, and jesting. It admits of four varieties. The first is pleasantry (<i>narman</i>), which is based on what is comic in speech, dress, or movement in the actors; the
pleasantry may be purely comic, or be mingled with love, or even with fear, as when
Susaṁgatā makes fun of Sāgarikā and adds that she will tell the queen of the episode
of the picture.<a class="noteRef" id="n326.2src" href="#n326.2">93</a> When love is mingled, it may serve to evince affection, or to ask for a response,
or to impute a fault on the lover’s part. A comedy of costume is seen in the <i>Nāgānanda</i> where the Viṭa, misled by his <span class="pageNum" id="pb327">[<a href="#pb327">327</a>]</span>garments, mistakes the Vidūṣaka for a woman; a comedy of action in the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> where Nipunikā punished the Vidūṣaka by dropping on him a stick which he takes, naturally
enough, for a snake. The second form is the outburst of affection (<i>narmasphūrja</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n327.1src" href="#n327.1">94</a> at the first meeting of lovers, which ends in a note of fear, as in the meeting of
the king and Mālavikā in Act IV of the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>. Thirdly, there is the manifestation of a recent love by physical signs (<i>narmasphoṭa</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="n327.2src" href="#n327.2">95</a> and, fourth, the development of affection (<i>narmagarbha</i>), illustrated by the adoption of a disguise by the hero to attain his end, as when
Vatsa in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> comes on the scene in the garb of Manoramā.<a class="noteRef" id="n327.3src" href="#n327.3">96</a>
</p>
<p>The grand manner is appropriate to the sentiments of heroism, wonder, and fury, and
in a less degree to the pathetic and erotic. Virtue, courage, self-sacrifice, compassion,
and righteousness are its subjects, not sorrow. Its divisions are the challenge (<i>utthāpaka</i>), as in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i>, Act V, Vālin defies Rāma; breach of alliance (<i>saṁghātya</i>) among one’s foes, which may be brought about by deliberate stratagem, as in the
<i>Mudrārākṣasa</i>, or by fate, as in the Rāma dramas Vibhīṣaṇa severs himself from Rāvaṇa; change of
action (<i>parivartaka</i>) as when in the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> Paraçurāma offers to embrace Rāma, whom he came to overthrow; and the dialogue (<i>saṁlāpa</i>) of warriors such as that of Rāma and Paraçurāma in the same play.
</p>
<p>The violent manner accords with the sentiments of fury, horror, and terror. It employs
magic, conjuration, conflicts, rage, fury, and underhand devices. Its elements include,
first, the almost immediate construction (<i>saṁkṣipti</i>) of some object by artificial means, such as the elephant of mats made to contain
Udayana’s men in the lost <i>Udayanacarita</i>; but others interpret this member as a sudden change of hero, whether real, as in
the substitution of Vālin for <span class="corr" id="xd32e12554" title="Source: Sugriva">Sugrīva</span>, or merely a change of heart on the hero’s part, as in Paraçurāma’s submission to
Rāma; in either case only a secondary hero can change or be changed, else the unity
of the drama would disappear. The other elements are the creation of an object by
magic means (<i>vastūtthāpana</i>); the angry meeting of <span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>two persons who end by fighting (<i>sampheṭa</i>), as do Mādhava and Aghoraghaṇṭa in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>; and a scene of tumultuous disturbance (<i>avapāta</i>), such as that when the monkey escapes in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> or of the attack on Vindhyaketu in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i>, Act I.
</p>
<p>The verbal manner is based on sound, as the other three are on sense. The voice only
is its means of expression; women may not use it, and the men must speak Sanskrit;
these actors bear the name Bharata, which is appropriated to this manner. It is adapted
to all the sentiments, or, according to the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, only to those of heroism, wonder, and fury. Its elements are, in true scholastic
fashion, likewise reckoned as four; two of them, the propitiation (<i>prarocanā</i>), and the introduction (<i>āmukha</i>, <i>prastāvanā</i>), essentially belong to the prologue of the drama, and will be considered in that
connexion; the other two are given as the garland (<i>vīthī</i>) and the farce, which are species of drama. But the theorists agree that the elements
(<i>an̄ga</i>) of the garland<a class="noteRef" id="n328.1src" href="#n328.1">97</a> are applicable in any part of the drama, especially the first juncture, and they
are evidently an essential part of the verbal manner.
</p>
<p>The first element is the abrupt dialogue (<i>udghātya</i>), which takes either the form of a series of questions and answers in explanation
of something not at once understood, or a monologue of question and reply. The second
is continuance (<i>avalagita</i>) of one section by another in substitution, as where, when Sītā has decided to go
to the forest for pleasure, Rāma is persuaded to let her go indeed, but into exile,
or, according to Dhanaṁjaya alone, where there is a sudden turn in an event in progress.<a class="noteRef" id="n328.2src" href="#n328.2">98</a> The third is the Prapañca, which passes for a comic dialogue, in which two actors
frankly set out each other’s demerits,<a class="noteRef" id="n328.3src" href="#n328.3">99</a> or, according to Viçvanātha, such a clever ruse as that of Nipuṇikā in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, Act II, where she worms out from the Vidūṣaka the king’s infatuation. The triple
explanation (<i>trigata</i>), a term which is used in a different sense in the rule regarding the prologue, seems
to denote guesses made at the cause of a sound, which in its character is ambiguous
and may be, e.g. the hum of the bees, the cry of the cuckoo, or the music <span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>made by celestial maidens.<a class="noteRef" id="n329.1src" href="#n329.1">100</a> Cheating (<i>chala</i>) denotes the use of words of seeming courtesy but boding ill, as in the inquiry for
Duryodhana, their foe, by Bhīma and Arjuna in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i>, Act V. The repartee (<i>vākkelī</i>) produces comic effect in a series of questions and answers; but the same term is
applied to the interruption of a sentence by Dhanaṁjaya, and by Viçvanātha to a single
reply to many questions. Outvying (<i>adhibala</i> or <i>atibala</i>) applies to a dialogue in which those conversing vie with one another in violence,
as in the discussion of Arjuna, Bhīma, and Duryodhana in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i>, Act V. The abrupt remark (<i>gaṇḍa</i>) is one which intervenes vitally in the tale; thus in the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> Rāma has just declared that separation from Sītā would be unbearable, when the porteress
announces Durmukha, the spy of the king, who comes to destroy the king’s happiness.
Reinterpretation (<i>avasyandita</i>) is the taking up of an expression which has escaped one in a different sense; thus
in the <i>Chalitarāma</i>, Sītā carelessly tells her sons to go to Ayodhyā and greet their father, and seeks
to remedy this slip by insisting that the king is father of his people. The enigma
(<i>nālikā</i>) conceals the sense under joking words. Incoherent talk (<i>asatpralāpa</i>) is the speech of one just awake, drunk, asleep, or childish; such are the hero’s
words in <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, Act IV. In another sense, admitted by Viçvanātha, it denotes good advice thrown
away, as in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i>, Act I, Gāndhārī’s admonition of Duryodhana. Humorous speech (<i>vyāhāra</i>) is a remark made for the sake of some one else, which provokes a laugh, as when
the Vidūṣaka in the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>, Act II, by his chatter makes the damsel laugh, and permits the king longer to gaze
on her charms. Mildness (<i>mṛdava</i>) denotes the turning of evil into good, or <i>vice versa</i>, as when in the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, Act II, the virtues of hunting, a vice in the eyes of the sacred law, are extolled.
</p>
<p>It is an essential defect of Indian theory in all its aspects that it tends to divisions
which are needless and confusing. Besides the elements of the garland we find thirty-three
dramatic ornaments (<i>nāṭyālaṁkāra</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n329.2src" href="#n329.2">101</a> and thirty-six characteristics or beauties (<i>lakṣaṇa</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="n329.3src" href="#n329.3">102</a> which cannot be distinguished as two classes on any <span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>conceivable theory,<a class="noteRef" id="n330.1src" href="#n330.1">103</a> for both consist largely of modes of exposition and figures of thought and diction,
while they also contain, as recognized by Dhanaṁjaya, a number of feelings which fall
within the sphere of sentiment and its discussion. Thus we find as ornaments the benediction,
the lamentation, raillery, the use of argument to support a view (<i>upapatti</i>), the prayer, the expression of resolution, the reproach, the provocation, the adduction
of a common opinion in order to administer covertly a rebuke, the request, the narrative,
reasoning, and the telling of a story. The beauties again include the combination
of merits of style with poetic figures; the grouping of letters to make up a name;
the use of analogy and example; the citation of admitted facts to refute incorrect
views; the fitting of expression to the sense; the explanation by reasoning of a fact
which is not capable of sense perception; the description of an object from the point
of view of place, time, or shape; the indication of a characteristic which serves
to distinguish two objects otherwise alike; the allusion to the truth of the literal
meaning of a name; the use of the names of famous persons in a eulogy of some living
being; the expression unconsciously, under the influence of passion, of the contrary
of what one means; the statement in succession (<i>mālā</i>) of several means to attain a desired object; the expression of two different views,
one of which in reality strengthens the other; the reproach; the question; the use
of commonplaces; eulogy; the employment of a comparison to convey a sense which it
is not desired directly to express; the indirect expression of desire; the veiled
compliment; and the address of gratitude. Unfortunately no scientific attempt at orderly
arrangement or examination of the principles on which these matters are based is attempted.
</p>
<p>The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n330.2src" href="#n330.2">104</a> adds an account of four ornaments of the drama (<i>nāṭakālaṁkāra</i>), which the <i>Daçarūpa</i> ignores, doubtless for the adequate reason that these matters appertain to poetics
in general, and they are treated of in vast detail by the text-books of that science.
The first is simile, defined as a comparison based on the similarity of characteristics
in two objects; there <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>are five kinds, the simile which extols, that which condemns, that with an imagined
thing, as when the elephant is likened to a winged mountain, that based on similarity,
and that on partial similarity, as in ‘Her face is like the full moon, her eyes like
the blue lotus’. The metaphor is an abridged comparison which unites the two objects
so as to efface their distinction, as ‘The fisher Love casts on the ocean of this
world his lure, woman’. The illuminator (<i>dīpaka</i>) is the figure of speech, which uses but one verb to express the connexion between
a subject series and a string of qualifications. Of forms of alliteration (<i>yamaka</i>), the repetition of vowels and consonants forming different words and meanings, there
are enumerated ten kinds, a striking proof of the importance attached to these verbal
jingles in early poetics.
</p>
<p>The Çāstra<a class="noteRef" id="n331.1src" href="#n331.1">105</a> adds some vague and valueless suggestions as to the use of these ornaments and metrical
effects in connexion with the expression of the sentiments. The erotic sentiment demands
metaphors and Dīpakas, and prefers the Āryā metre. The heroic affects short syllables,
similes, and metaphors; in passages of lively dialogue the metres<a class="noteRef" id="n331.2src" href="#n331.2">106</a> Jagatī, Atijagatī, and Saṁkṛti; in scenes of battle and violence, the Utkṛti. The
sentiment of fury adopts the same metres, and also favours short syllables, similes,
and metaphors. The Çakvarī and Atidhṛti metres are appropriate to the pathetic sentiment;
it prefers long syllables, a liking shared by the sentiment of horror.
</p>
<p>An effort is made by later writers on poetics to apply to the doctrine of the sentiments
the theory of excellencies (<i>guṇa</i>), which is laid down generally in Daṇḍin, Vāmana, Bhoja, and other writers. In Daṇḍin<a class="noteRef" id="n331.3src" href="#n331.3">107</a> we find assigned to the Vaidarbha style a miscellaneous number of qualities, ten
in all, which are defined in terms sometimes vague and unsatisfactory; these qualities
include both those of sense and sound (<i>artha</i> and <i>çabda</i>). They include strength or majesty (<i>ojas</i>), elevation (<i>udāratva</i>), clearness (<i>prasāda</i>), precision of exposition (<i>arthavyakti</i>), beauty or attractiveness (<i>kānti</i>), sweetness or elegance (<i>mādhurya</i>), metaphorical language (<i>samādhi</i>), and in the use and combination of sounds homogeneity (<i>samatā</i>), softness (<i>sukumāratā</i>), and a natural flow (<i>çleṣa</i>). The chief opponent of the Vaidarbha style is given as the Gauḍa; it is vaguely
credited with the possession <span class="pageNum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>of features the opposite of those of its rival; more specifically, we find it credited
with the fondness for the use of long compounds both in prose and verse, while the
Vaidarbha objects to such compounds in verse at least, and with affecting alliterations.
Vāmana<a class="noteRef" id="n332.1src" href="#n332.1">108</a> develops the doctrine by distinguishing ten qualities of sense and ten of sound,
and he ascribes all the qualities to the Vaidarbha style; to the Gauḍa he allots reliance
on force and beauty, to the exclusion of sweetness and softness, while he recognizes
as a third style the Pāñcāla, which is marked with sweetness and softness, and therefore
is rather feeble. In Mammaṭa<a class="noteRef" id="n332.2src" href="#n332.2">109</a> and later we find a new view of the qualities; those of sense are explained away
as being rather the absence of defects (<i>doṣa</i>), so that the qualities are reduced to the sphere of sound alone. In this regard
they are further reduced from ten to three, sweetness, strength, and clearness, and
these are now brought into effective connexion with the sentiments.
</p>
<p>Sweetness, the source of pleasure, causing as it were the melting of the heart, is
appropriate in the sentiments of love in enjoyment, pathos, love in separation, and
calm; it is normal in love in union, and rises in degree successively in the other
three forms of sentiment; unmixed in the others, in that of calm it is combined with
a small degree of strength, because of the relation of the sentiment of calm to the
emotion of disgust. Strength causes the expansion of the heart; it rises in vehemence
in the sentiments of heroism, horror, and fury, and it is found also in that of terror.
The quality of clearness is appropriate to all the sentiments, and is that which causes
the sense to become intelligible, pervading the mind as fire does wood or water a
cloth, as the outcome of merely hearing the words. The precise mode in which sweetness
is produced is by the use of mutes other than cerebrals, with their appropriate nasals,
<i>r</i> and <i>ṇ</i> with short vowels, and no compounds or short compounds; strength results from the
use of compound letters, doubled letters, conjunct consonants of which <i>r</i> forms part, cerebrals other than <i>ṇ</i>, palatal and cerebral sibilants, and long compounds. The older names, Vaidarbha,
Gauḍa, and Pāñcāla are now given up in favour of refined (<i>upanāgarikā</i>), <span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>harsh (<i>paruṣā</i>), and soft (<i>komalā</i>). But Mammaṭa reminds us that in drama very long compounds are undesirable, a rule
ignored largely by the later dramatists.
</p>
<p>More important than these technical details, which are illustrated often enough in
the verses composed by the later dramatists, and no doubt possess considerable antiquity,
is the changed view<a class="noteRef" id="n333.1src" href="#n333.1">110</a> which brings the qualities in the new sense into relation with the sentiment. Sentiment
is the very soul of poetry, and the relation of the qualities to it may be most effectually
compared with that of such virtues as heroism to the soul of man. They serve to heighten
the effect of the sentiment, and therefore they cannot be considered save in close
relation to that sentiment. However soft and sweet the verbal form of a work, none
the less it cannot be said to possess the quality of sweetness, unless it has a sentiment
to which sweetness is appropriate. To give it the name of sweet, if the sentiment
is incompatible with sweetness, is compared with regarding a tall man as brave on
the strength of his appearance only. The sounds, therefore, produce the qualities
only as instruments, for the real cause is the sentiment, even as the soul is the
true cause of the heroism and other qualities of a man.
</p>
<p>The case of figures, whether of sound or sense, is somewhat similarly handled; the
figures are compared with the ornaments which, placed on a man’s body, and through
this union with him, gratify the soul; the figures adorn words and meanings which
are parts of poetry by their union with them, and thus serve to heighten the sentiment,
provided one exists. If there is no sentiment, through the defective ability of the
poet, then the figures serve merely to lend variety to the composition, and even when
sentiment exists the figures may fail to be appropriate to it. Both figures and qualities
thus are in a very intimate relation with the sentiment, but that does not mean that
the two are identical.
</p>
<p>From this doctrine, which makes sentiment essentially the main element in poetry,
the view of Vāmana,<a class="noteRef" id="n333.2src" href="#n333.2">111</a> who laid down that style was the soul of poetry and that the qualities give the essential
beauty or distinction (<i>çobhā</i>) to a poem, while the figures <span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>increase such distinction, is necessarily regarded as inadequate. If the doctrine
is interpreted to mean that it is the possession of all the qualities which makes
a poem, then all compositions in the Gauḍa and Pāñcāla styles would be denied the
rank of poetry; if the presence of a single quality gave the right to the style of
poem, then a perfectly prosaic verse passage containing the quality of strength would
have to be dubbed a poem, while a stanza containing elegant figures, but no qualities,
would be denied that style, which in point of fact is regularly accorded by usage
and must be recognized as valid.
</p>
<p>As regards language we have, as often in the theory, no explanation of a principle
which is laid down as accepted, the divergent use of Sanskrit and Prākrit in the same
play. Yet it cannot be held that, when the theory was developed in such works as the
<i>Daçarūpa</i>, and very possibly in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> itself, the usage of the plays could be put down simply to the copying of the actual
practice in real life. That such was its origin we may believe in the general way;
the Vidūṣaka in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> derides a woman using Sanskrit as resembling a young cow with a rope through her
nose; but there is evidence that already in the time of the <i>Kāmaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n334.1src" href="#n334.1">112</a> the use of Prākrit was artificial. We are there told that the cultured man about
town (<i>nāgaraka</i>) in social meetings (<i>goṣṭhī</i>), should neither confine himself to Sanskrit nor to the vernacular (<i>deçabhāṣā</i>) if he is to win repute for good manners. We have here a sign that matters were already,
at the time of the <i>Kāmaçāstra</i>, much in the same condition as in modern India, where the use of Sanskrit terms with
the vernacular is a regular sign of education. Now Vātsyāyana tells us clearly that
those who frequent such gatherings are hetaerae, Viṭas, Vidūṣakas, and Pīṭhamardas,
in short the wits of the court, and to them in the theory is assigned Çaurasenī and
kindred Prākrit dialects. We are justified, therefore, in assuming that at Vātsyāyana’s
epoch in actual life, as opposed to the conventional existence of the stage, Prākrits
were definitely out of employment. The same text includes in the requisites of the
knowledge of a hetaera the knowledge of the local speech, and, as there is no doubt
of the knowledge of the Andhras as kings by Vātsyāyana, it is interesting to note
that in the famous passage <span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>in which Somadeva tells of the reason why the <i>Bṛhatkathā</i><a class="noteRef" id="n335.1src" href="#n335.1">113</a> was written in Paiçācī he treats as the three forms of human speech contemporaneous
with Sātavāhana, whose name shows his connexion with the Andhras, Sanskrit, Prākrit,
and the vernacular.
</p>
<p>The date of Vātsyāyana thus becomes of interest, but unluckily it is still undefined
with any precision.<a class="noteRef" id="n335.2src" href="#n335.2">114</a> It certainly seems, however, that Kālidāsa was familiar with a text very similar
to and perhaps identical with the <i>Kāmaçāstra</i>, and this reasonably may be regarded as giving <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 400 as the lower limit of date. That the <i>Kauṭilīya Arthaçāstra</i> has been used by Vātsyāyana gives no precise result, in view of the difficulty of
dating exactly that text. But the mention by Vātsyāyana of the Ābhīras<a class="noteRef" id="n335.3src" href="#n335.3">115</a> and Andhras certainly suggests, taken into conjunction with his silence as to the
Guptas, that he wrote before the power of the latter had established itself in western
India, and we may assign his work to approximately <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 300. If so we must believe that already in Kālidāsa’s age the Prākrits of his characters
were more or less artificial, and with this well accords his introduction of Māhārāṣṭrī
for the verses of those to whom Çaurasenī is assigned in prose, an obviously literary
device.
</p>
<p>Elaborate rules for the use of language<a class="noteRef" id="n335.4src" href="#n335.4">116</a> by the characters are given in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> and, in much less detail, by the <i>Daçarūpa</i>. The use of Sanskrit is proper in the case of kings, Brahmins, generals, ministers,
and learned persons generally; the chief queen is assigned it, and so also ministers’
daughters, but this rule is not in practice observed. On the other hand, it is used
by Buddhist nuns, hetaerae, artistes, and others on occasion. It is a rule that in
the description of battles, peace negotiations, and omens Sanskrit shall be resorted
to, and this is done by Bṛhannalā in Bhāsa’s <i>Pañcarātra</i>. The use of Sanskrit by allegorical female types is also found both early and late.
</p>
<p>The general rule for women and persons of inferior rank<a class="noteRef" id="n335.5src" href="#n335.5">117</a> is <span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>the use of Prākrit, but it may be resorted to as a means of self-aid by persons of
higher position. The types of Prākrit to be used are described with much confusion
in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, and the amount of variation contemplated is large. Thus the use of Çaurasenī is
permitted in the Çāstra in lieu of the dialect of the Barbara, Andhra, Kirāta, and
Draviḍa, though these may be used. The Çāstra gives seven different Prākrits as in
use. Çaurasenī is the speech of the land between the Yamunā and the Gan̄gā or Doab;
it is to be used by the ladies of the play, their friends and servants, generally
by ladies of good family and many men of the middle class. Prācyā is assigned to the
Vidūṣaka, but in fact he speaks practically Çaurasenī, and therefore the term can
only denote an eastern Çaurasenī dialect. Āvantī is ascribed to gamblers or rogues
(<i>dhūrta</i>), but is only an aspect of Çaurasenī, as spoken at Ujjayinī, and the Prākrit grammarian
Mārkaṇḍeya calls it a transition between Çaurasenī and Māhārāṣṭrī. Māhārāṣṭrī is unknown
to the Çāstra; it is assigned to the verses of persons who use Çaurasenī by the <i>Daçarūpa</i>, while the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i> limits it to the verses of women; normally, but not absolutely, it is used in all
verses,<a class="noteRef" id="n336.1src" href="#n336.1">118</a> though Çaurasenī verses occasionally occur, and possibly were more frequent originally.
The earlier drama of Açvaghoṣa and Bhāsa has no clear evidence of Māhārāṣṭrī at all.
Ardha-Māgadhī is prescribed for slaves (<i>ceṭa</i>), Rājaputras and guildsmen (<i>çreṣṭhin</i>) by the Çāstra, but, save in Açvaghoṣa and possibly the <i>Karṇabhāra</i> of Bhāsa, it is unknown to our dramas. Māgadhī, on the other hand, is important in
theory, and of some consequence in practice; it is ascribed to all those men who live
in the women’s apartments, diggers of underground passages, keepers of drink shops,
watchers, and is used in time of danger by the hero, and also by the Çakāra, according
to the Çāstra. The <i>Daçarūpa</i> assigns it and Paiçācī to the lowest classes, which accords with facts as regards
Māgadhī, but Paiçācī is not found clearly in the dramas.
</p>
<p>The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> provides for the use of Dākṣiṇātyā in the case of soldiers (<i>yodha</i>), police officers (<i>nāgaraka</i>), and gamblers (<i>dīvyant</i>), and there are slight traces in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> of the existence of this dialect. Bālhīkā is assigned by the same <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>authority to the Khasas and the northerners, but has not yet been traced in any drama.
</p>
<p>We learn also from the Çāstra and from Mārkaṇḍeya in special of a number of Vibhāṣās,<a class="noteRef" id="n337.1src" href="#n337.1">119</a> which seem to be modified forms of the more normal Prākrits, as stereotyped for use
by certain characters in the drama. Thus the Çāstra attributes Çākārī to the Çakas,
Çabaras, and others, while the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i> accords Çābarī to these persons. The Çāstra ascribes Çābarī to charcoal-burners,
hunters, wood-workers, and partly also to forest dwellers in general, and Ābhīrī is
ascribed with the option of Çābarī to herdsmen, Cāṇḍālī to Caṇḍālas, and Drāviḍī to
Draviḍas, while Oḍri, mentioned by the Çāstra, is left unascribed; presumably it was
assigned to men of Orissa. Something of this is seen in the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, where Çākārī, Cāṇḍālī, and a further speech Ḍhakkī or Ṭākkī appear. They all have
nothing very marked as to their characteristics; the first two may be allied to Māgadhī,
the last is more dubious.
</p>
<p>The addition of Chāyās or translations in Sanskrit to explain the Prākrit is normal
in the manuscripts of the dramas, and it is certain that it is old, for it is alluded
to by Rājaçekhara in his <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i>. Evidently, even so early as <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 900, there was no public which cared for Prākrit without a Sanskrit explanation.
</p>
<p>On the subject of the use of stanzas, as opposed to prose, the text-books are curiously
and unexpectedly silent.<a class="noteRef" id="n337.2src" href="#n337.2">120</a> This indicates how entirely empirical they are in these matters. The use of Prākrits
in the dramas obviously varied, and something had to be said regarding this point,
but the alternation of prose and verse is accepted as something established, on which
comment is unnecessary. The fact is recognized, but its implications and purpose remain
unexplored. In the stanzas themselves, it is clear, we must distinguish between those
which were sung and those which were simply recited; recitation must clearly have
been the normal form of use, and as sung we have normally at any rate only some of
the stanzas in Māhārāṣṭrī which are placed in the mouths of women. Çaurasenī stanzas,
on the other hand, <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>we may assume to have been recited, but the distinction has practically vanished from
the texts preserved.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">7.</span> <i>The Dance, Song, and Music</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the part played by the song, dance, and music in the drama the theorists curiously
enough tell us comparatively little of interest, though it is certain that both were
most important elements in the production of sentiment. The types of dance recognized
in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> are two, the violent dance of men, invented by Çiva himself, the Tāṇḍava, and the
tender and voluptuous dance of Pārvatī, the Lāsya. The latter alone, by reason of
its special importance, is carefully analysed into ten parts by the Çāstra,<a class="noteRef" id="n338.1src" href="#n338.1">121</a> which shows the essential union of song and dance. The first is the song proper,
which is sung by one seated, to the accompaniment of a lute, without dancing; the
recitation standing (<i>sthitapāṭhya</i>) is a declamation in Prākrit by a woman pacing rapidly under the influence of love,
or it may also mean, according to Abhinavagupta, a declamation by a woman in anger.
The recitation sitting (<i>āsīna</i>) is performed by a woman lying down, under the stress of sorrow, without musical
accompaniment. In the Puṣpagaṇḍikā various metres are used; Sanskrit may be employed;
men act as women and <i>vice versa</i>, and there is a musical accompaniment. In the Pracchedaka a woman sings to the lute
her grief at her lover’s infidelity. The Trigūḍha is the acting of a man in woman’s
dress, as of Makaranda in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>, Act VI. The Saindhava is a song to a clear accompaniment of a lady whose love has
failed to keep his tryst. The Dvigūḍhaka is a harmonious song, full of sentiment,
in dialogue form. The Uttamottaka is a song filled with the bitterness of a troubled
love. The Uktapratyukta is a duet, in which one lover addresses to the other feigned
reproaches. These divisions, of course, appear to ignore their nature as parts of
a dance, but it must be remembered that the motions of the performers are essential
in the performance.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span></p>
<p>The music of the drama is not described at length in the later theorists; what is
clear is that each sentiment has its special appropriate music, and each action its
special accompaniment. Thus the Dvipadikās accompanied the performance of the rôles
of persons distressed, unwell, and unhappy; the Dhruvās were chosen so as to intimate
at once to the audience the quality of the new arrival on the stage.<a class="noteRef" id="n339.1src" href="#n339.1">122</a>

<p class="first">The <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e13024" title="Source: Naṭyaçāstra">Nāṭyaçāstra</span></i><a class="noteRef" id="n339.2src" href="#n339.2">123</a> prescribes an elaborate series of preliminaries (<i>pūrvaran̄ga</i>) which must be performed before the actual drama begins; they are intended to secure
divine favour for the performance, each act having a definite share in the result,
and doubtless they present us with a reminiscence of the early theatre in the mingling
of music, dance, and song. First there is the beat of drum (<i>pratyāhāra</i>) announcing the beginning of the performance, and the carpet is spread out for the
orchestra; the singers and the musicians then enter and take their places (<i>avataraṇa</i>): then the chorus try their voices (<i>ārambha</i>); the musicians try their instruments (<i>āçrāvaṇā</i>); they tune up their wind and string instruments, and manipulate their hands to make
them ready for the work; then an instrumental concert follows, succeeded by the appearance
and practice steps of the dancers.<a class="noteRef" id="n339.3src" href="#n339.3">124</a> A song follows, to please the gods; then the Tāṇḍava is performed, increasing in
violence as it proceeds; then a song accompanies the raising by the Sūtradhāra of
the banner (<i>jarjara</i>) of Indra; he scatters flowers and purifies himself with water from a pitcher borne
by an attendant, while another carries the banner; there follows a perambulation of
the stage, the praise of the world guardians, and homage to the banner. Then comes
the Nāndī or benediction; it is followed by the recitation by the Sūtradhāra of a
verse in honour of the god whose festival it is, <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>or the king or a Brahmin; then comes the Ran̄gadvāra, which is said to mark the beginning
of the dramatic action (<i>abhinaya</i>), the Sūtradhāra reciting another verse, and bowing before the banner of Indra. There
follow steps and movements of erotic character (<i>cārī</i>) in honour of Umā, and more violent movements of the same kind in honour of the Bhūtas.
A discussion (<i>trigata</i>) between the Sūtradhāra, the Vidūṣaka, who talks nonsense, and an attendant follows.
Finally the Prarocanā announces the content of the drama, and the Sūtradhāra and his
two attendants leave the stage, and the preliminaries are ended.
</p>
<p>Immediately after, according to the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, another person, similar in appearance and qualities to the Sūtradhāra, is to enter
and introduce the play, a function which gives him the style of introducer, Sthāpaka.<a class="noteRef" id="n340.1src" href="#n340.1">125</a> His costume should indicate the nature of the drama, as dealing with divine or human
affairs. An appropriate song greets his entrance, he dances a Cārī, praises the gods
and Brahmins, propitiates the audience by verses alluding to the subject of the play,
mentions the name of the author and the play, and describes some season in the verbal
manner, thereby opening the prologue (<i>prastāvanā</i>, <i>āmukha</i>, <i>sthāpanā</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n340.2src" href="#n340.2">126</a> of the play. The essential feature of the prologue is an address by the director
with an attendant (<i>pāripārçvika</i>) or an actress or the Vidūṣaka on some personal business which indirectly hints at
the drama. The mode of connexion is given by Dhanaṁjaya as threefold, as in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>; the words of the director may be caught up (<i>kathodghāta</i>) by a character in the drama, entering from behind the curtain, as in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> Yaugandharāyaṇa catches up the consolation offered to the actress which is applicable
to his own scheme, and in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i> Bhīma brusquely denounces the benediction of his adversaries. Or a person may enter
(<i>pravṛttaka</i>), who has just been mentioned by the director in a comparison with the season of
the year, as in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i>. Excess of representation (<i>prayogātiçaya</i>) is taken in the <i>Daçarūpa</i> as applying to a case where the director actually mentions the entry of a character
of the drama, as at the beginning of the <i>Çakuntalā</i>, where he assures the actress that her song has enchanted him, as the <span class="pageNum" id="pb341">[<a href="#pb341">341</a>]</span>gazelle enchants Duḥṣanta, who just then enters. Viçvanātha, on the other hand, treats
this form as an instance of continuance (<i>avalagita</i>), and interprets the phrase as denoting the supersession of the director’s action;
thus, in the lost <i>Kundamālā</i>, about to call on the actress to dance, he hears the word, ‘Lady, descend’, and realizes
that it is a reference to Sītā, who is being led into exile. He admits also the abrupt
dialogue (<i>udghātya</i>) as a means of connexion; thus in the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i> the director alludes to the demon of eclipse as eager to triumph over Candra, the
moon, and Cāṇakya behind the scenes calls out, ‘Who then while I live claims to triumph
over Candragupta?’ and enters a moment later. The theorist Nakhakuṭṭa is also credited
with the view that a voice behind the scenes or from the air may be used to introduce
the chief personage.
</p>
<p>This account of the preliminaries and the prelude presents obvious difficulties both
in itself and in connexion with the actual specimens of the Sanskrit drama. The <i>Daçarūpa</i> and Viçvanātha alike give no details of the preliminaries, and the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> indicates that, in addition to the complete form of Pūrvaran̄ga, there might be an
abbreviated form and also an extended form with additional ceremonials. There is an
obvious overlapping between the Pūrvaran̄ga and the rest of the performance, for the
last element of the former, the giving the content of the drama in the Prarocanā,
is essentially an element in the latter. We are quite definitely told by Viçvanātha
that in his time there was not a complete performance of the preliminaries; when,
therefore, we find in Bhāsa’s dramas that there is no mention of the name of the author
or the drama in the prologue, we may safely assume that it was after his time that
the practice grew up of transferring from the preliminaries, which were not a matter
for the poet, the substance of the Prarocanā, and embodying it in the poet’s own work.
In Viçvanātha’s time also we are told that the Sūtradhāra or director performed the
whole of the work assigned in the theory to him and the Sthāpaka. But it is extremely
difficult to say how far back this goes; the extant dramas with occasional exceptions,<a class="noteRef" id="n341.1src" href="#n341.1">127</a> such as Rājaçekhara’s <i>Karpūramañjarī</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>and Mādhava’s <i>Subhadrāharaṇa</i> mention only the Sūtradhāra, and Pischel<a class="noteRef" id="n342.1src" href="#n342.1">128</a> suggested that it was Bhāsa who banished the Sthāpaka, in view of the reference in
Bāṇa to his dramas as begun by the Sūtradhāra. It is uncertain, however, what precisely
the sense of this reference is. The <i>Daçarūpa</i> expressly provides for the activity of the Sthāpaka, but then proceeds to style him
Sūtradhāra, and there is agreement that he is to have the attributes of the Sūtradhāra,
so that the use of the name may merely be explained by this reason. This is certainly
supported by the express reference in the <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i> to the transfer of his functions to the Sūtradhāra and the silence of the <i>Daçarūpa</i> on this head. The point would be of importance only if it meant that Bhāsa dropped
the Pūrvaran̄ga as part of the drama; nothing, however, even hints at this; as we
have seen, his omission to name himself or his play in the prologue tells strongly
in favour of the view that the old Prarocanā was still in use.
</p>
<p>More complex still is the question of the Nāndī or benediction. Most Sanskrit dramas
open with a verse or verses of this type, followed by the remark, ‘At the close of
the Nāndī the Sūtradhāra enters,’ but in Bhāsa’s dramas, in old manuscripts of the
<i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, and now and then in South Indian manuscripts of such plays as the <i>Nāgānanda</i>, the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i>, and other more modern dramas,<a class="noteRef" id="n342.2src" href="#n342.2">129</a> we find the play begun with these words, and a verse or verses following. We have
also the direct testimony of Viçvanātha, who tells us that some authorities held that
the introductory verse in the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> which normally passes for the Nāndī was not that at all, but was the Ran̄gadvāra,
with which, according to the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, the play properly begins, as in it we first find acting in the shape of a combination
of speech and action; that verse, they argued, could not be reconciled with the definition
of the extent of the Nāndī given in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>; others, however, on the authority of Abhinavagupta repelled this objection. Viçvanātha
adopts as the definition of Nāndī what is recited in praise of a deity, Brahmin, king
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>or the like, and is accompanied by a benediction, consisting of twelve inflected words
(with nominal or verbal endings) or eight lines (quarter-verses); this would exclude
the beginning of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i>, but Abhinavagupta permits of a greater variety of forms. In Viçvanātha’s view the
Nāndī is part of the preliminaries, which must be preserved, however much these are
shortened. It is clear, therefore, that gradually the benediction, like the Prarocanā
with its appeal to the benevolence of the audience,<a class="noteRef" id="n343.1src" href="#n343.1">130</a> came to be worked into the play by the author himself, though the period when the
custom became normal cannot be stated with any precision, and in the south of India,
at any rate, the older practice of leaving the benediction to the Sūtradhāra seems
to have been sometimes followed. There can, indeed, be little doubt that the extent
to which the preliminaries were retained differed from time to time; Viçvanātha evidently
contemplates their almost total disappearance, but the <i>Amṛtodaya</i> of Gokulanātha in the sixteenth century assumes their presence; the authority of
the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> told heavily in their favour, and the stock phrase, ‘Enough of this ceremony,’ which
occurs frequently at the opening of the plays, doubtless refers to the dance, song,
and music with which the drama was prefaced.<a class="noteRef" id="n343.2src" href="#n343.2">131</a>
</p>
<p>These facts explain the confusion<a class="noteRef" id="n343.3src" href="#n343.3">132</a> of the notices of the theorists as to the actor by whom the benediction is to be
recited. We find ascribed to Bharata the view that a special actor, the Nāndī, should
recite it, or that duty should be performed by the Sūtradhāra; another authority permits
the Sūtradhāra or any other actor to recite it. The situation is complicated by the
rule that at the end of the preliminaries the Sūtradhāra is supposed to leave the
stage and the Sthāpaka to come on, while our dramas, as a rule, have the benediction
followed by the entry of the Sūtradhāra, or rarely, as in the <i>Pārthaparākrama</i>, the Sthāpaka. The theory, therefore, suggests that the benediction is recited by
the Sūtradhāra or <span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>Sthāpaka (called Sūtradhāra by reason of similarity of function and character) behind
the curtain, and then he enters on the stage. The matter is not cleared up by the
practice followed in the embryo dramas introduced into others: in that included in
the <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> the Sūtradhāra recites a benediction of twelve inflected words, and then proceeds
with the prologue without a break; in the <i>Jānakīpariṇaya</i> it is one of the actors who does so, as in Ravivarman’s <i>Pradyumnābhyudaya</i>, the director then beginning the play; in the <i>Caitanyacandrodaya</i> the benediction is recited behind the curtain, but that is stated to be because the
piece to be acted is a Bhāṇa or Vyāyoga, implying that in other cases it normally
was recited on the stage, presumably by an actor other than the director.
</p>
<p>The extent of the benediction was, as we have seen, disputed.<a class="noteRef" id="n344.1src" href="#n344.1">133</a> Bharata’s rule of eight or twelve Padas does not stand alone, for he is credited
with mentioning four or sixteen as possible numbers, and Pada may mean inflected word,
line, or proposition. Abhinavagupta allows three, six, or twelve Padas in a benediction
of three times; four, eight, or sixteen in one of four times; and definitely takes
Pada as proposition; illustrations of eight- and twelve-Pada benedictions of this
type are given by Abhinavagupta and Bharata. The dramas differ; the <i>Çakuntalā</i> has one of eight propositions or four lines; the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> four stanzas; the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> and the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i> eight lines each; the <i>Uttararāmacarita</i> twelve words.
</p>
<p>Harmony between the benediction and the character of the drama is naturally demanded
by the theory, and is observed largely in practice; thus the <i>Prabodhacandrodaya</i>, a philosophic drama, begins with an adoration of the sole reality, the <i>Mudrārākṣasa</i>, a drama of political intrigue, with a verse as tortuous as the diplomacy of Cāṇakya.
It is a characteristic of the determination to carry matters to extremes which distinguishes
Indian theory that attempts are made to extract from the benediction not merely a
general harmony with the theme, but also a reference both to the main characters and
to the chief events.<a class="noteRef" id="n344.2src" href="#n344.2">134</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">9.</span> <i>The Types of Drama</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The types of drama are distinguished by the theorists according to the use which they
make of the various dramatic elements enumerated. The highest of the ten main forms,
Rūpakas, is the Nāṭaka or heroic comedy. The term is generic; it may denote any representation
whether by pictures or dumb show, but it has also the more important specific sense
of the drama proper.
</p>
<p>The subject of a Nāṭaka<a class="noteRef" id="n345.1src" href="#n345.1">135</a> should be drawn from tradition, not invented; the hero should be a king, royal sage,
or god, who may appear in human form; the dominant sentiment must be the heroic or
the erotic, but all may be illustrated, and that of wonder is well suited for the
<i>dénouement</i>, which should be led up to through the whole series of stages of the action and junctures.
The end must be happy; tragedy is forbidden, though the prohibition is unexplained.
The prose should be simple without elaborate compounds; the verses clear and sweet;
the Prākrits should be varied; the whole style noble and harmonious, with full use
of all the beauties and the adventitious attractions of the song and the dance as
well as music. The number of acts should be from five to ten; if a play contains every
kind of episode, it is styled a Mahānāṭaka, if it has ten acts. The rule is generally
obeyed, but late dramas styling themselves Nāṭakas are known of one (Ravidāsa’s <i>Mithyājñānaviḍambana</i>), two (Vedāntavāgīça’s <i>Bhojacarita</i>), three, or four acts,<a class="noteRef" id="n345.2src" href="#n345.2">136</a> and one comparatively early work exists in one version of fourteen acts, without
any passage in Prākrit, the <i>Mahānāṭaka</i>; the <i>Adbhutārṇava</i> of a Kavibhūṣaṇa has twelve acts. The name of a Nāṭaka should be derived from the
hero or the subject-matter, and this is regularly the case. Four or five is the number
of chief personages permitted.
</p>
<p>The bourgeois comedy, Prakaraṇa,<a class="noteRef" id="n345.3src" href="#n345.3">137</a> is a comedy of manners of a rank below royalty, which in the main follows the laws
of construction of the Nāṭaka. The subject-matter is to be framed at his good pleasure
by the poet. The hero should be <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>a Brahmin, minister, or merchant, who has fallen on evil days and is seeking through
difficulties to attain property, love, and the performance of duty, in which he at
last succeeds. The heroine may be of three types, a lady of good family, as in the
lost <i>Puṣpadūṣita</i> (<i>°bhūṣita</i>); a hetaera as in the lost <i>Taran̄gadatta</i>; or a lady of good family may share the honours with a hetaera, with whom, however,
she may not come in contact, as in the <i>Cārudatta</i> and the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>. The drama offers an appropriate place for slaves, Viṭas, merchant chiefs, and rogues
of various kinds. The erotic sentiment should dominate, though Dhanaṁjaya allows also
the heroic, and the structure should include all five junctures. The number of acts
should be as in the Nāṭaka, and the name be derived from the hero or heroine or both,
as in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> and the <i>Çāriputraprakaraṇa</i> of Açvaghoṣa. It must, however, be noted that the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i> has but four acts, and the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, unlike the <i>Cārudatta</i>, does not follow the rule as to name.
</p>
<p>The supernatural drama, Samavakāra,<a class="noteRef" id="n346.1src" href="#n346.1">138</a> is described in our sources obviously on the basis of a single play, the <i>Amṛtamanthana</i>, the churning of the ocean to obtain the ambrosia, at which all participants attained
their desires. The precise duration of each of its three acts is given, at twelve,
four, and two Nāḍikās (of forty-eight minutes). The subject must be taken from a tale
of the gods and demons. The juncture, pause, is omitted, and the expansion (<i>bindu</i>) as an element of the plot. The number of heroes may reach twelve, each pursuing
an object which he attains. The heroic sentiment dominates. Each act exhibits one
type of cheating, tumultuous action, and love. The graceful manner is excluded, or
but faintly developed; the Uṣṇih, Kuṭila, and Anuṣṭubh metres are appropriate. The
description fits but loosely Bhāsa’s <i>Pañcarātra</i>, the only old drama to which that name may plausibly be applied.
</p>
<p>The Īhāmṛga,<a class="noteRef" id="n346.2src" href="#n346.2">139</a> of which no old example is known, owes its name, according to the <i>Daçarūpāvaloka</i> to the fact that in it a maiden as hard to attain as a gazelle (<i>mṛga</i>) is sought after (<i>īhā</i>). The subject is one partly derived from legend and partly <span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>the poet’s imagination; in special, if the legend relates the death of a great man,
this result must be avoided. The essence of the drama is that some one seeks to deprive
the hero, who on one view may be divine or human, on another divine only, of a heavenly
maiden; the result is a conflict of wills, but actual fighting is to be avoided by
artifice. The hero and his rival must both be of the noble and haughty type; the latter
must do wrong in error. Only the first two and the last junctures are allowed, and
the graceful style is excluded. There are four acts, but Viçvanātha mentions a view
which allows one act only and makes the hero a god, or six rivals for a divine maiden’s
hand.
</p>
<p>The Ḍima<a class="noteRef" id="n347.1src" href="#n347.1">140</a> is also little known, though the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> cites a <i>Tripuradāha</i> as a specimen. Its subject is to be legendary; there is to be no pause juncture.
The heroes are sixteen gods, demi-gods, and demons, all of the haughty type; magic,
sorcery, combats, eclipses of the sun and moon are in place. The erotic and comic
sentiments are excluded, that of fury is predominant. There are four acts without
introductory scenes of any kind, but the late <i>Manmathonmathana</i> of Rāma has them. The graceful manner is forbidden. It is clear that the type is
described on the basis of inadequate material; it may represent a popular form of
entertainment which did not attain full recognition. The origin of the name is unknown,
for no root <i>ḍim</i>, to wound, is found in the language, though Dhanika asserts its existence.
</p>
<p>The Vyāyoga<a class="noteRef" id="n347.2src" href="#n347.2">141</a> is, as its name suggests, a military spectacle. Its subject must be legendary, its
hero a god or royal sage, but Dhanaṁjaya allows a man. It is in one act, the action
not extending over a day, and it is filled with strife and battle, the intervention
of women as the cause of battle being excluded. The first two and last junctures alone
are permitted, the erotic and comic sentiments are barred, and the graceful manner.
The type is old, for it is found in Bhāsa and revives later.
</p>
<p>The Act or Isolated Act (An̄ka, <span class="corr" id="xd32e13378" title="Source: Utṣṛṣṭikān̄ka">Utsṛṣṭikān̄ka</span>)<a class="noteRef" id="n347.3src" href="#n347.3">142</a> is a single-act piece, whose longer style serves to discriminate it from an act of
<span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>a normal drama. Its subject is taken from legend, but may be developed by the poet;
the first and last junctures alone are permitted. The hero should be human, of the
common folk, according to the later theory. The sentiment should be the pathetic,
and the style the verbal. The laments of women should accompany the description of
battles and fights, but these should not take place on the stage. Viçvanātha gives
the <i>Çarmiṣṭhāyayāti</i> as an example, but the type is not represented by any early play.
</p>
<p>The farce, Prahasana,<a class="noteRef" id="n348.1src" href="#n348.1">143</a> on the other hand, has every sign of popular origin and vogue. The subject is the
poet’s invention; it deals essentially with the tricks and quarrels of low characters
of every kind. There is but one act, and only the first and last junctures; the comic
sentiment predominates. The <i>Daçarūpa</i> recognizes three kinds; the pure is that in which heretics, Brahmins, men- and maid-servants
and parasites are represented in appropriate costume and language; the modified represents
eunuchs, chamberlains, and ascetics in the garb, and with the speech, of lovers; and
the mixed is styled so because it contains the elements of the Vīthī, and is filled
with rogues. Only the first and last are recognized by the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, the second being included in the third, while Viçvanātha recognizes the possibility
of there being only one hero or several, and allows the use of two acts in such a
case, as in the <i>Laṭakamelaka</i>. The graceful and violent manners are excluded.
</p>
<p>The monologue, Bhāṇa,<a class="noteRef" id="n348.2src" href="#n348.2">144</a> has also an obviously popular character and origin. The subject-matter is invented
by the poet; a parasite sets forth his own or another’s adventures, appealing to both
the heroic and the erotic sentiments by descriptions of heroism and beauty in the
verbal manner. There are only the first and last junctures, and but one act. The actor
speaks in the air, repeating answers supposed to be received. The elements of the
Lāsya are specially in place, a fact which shows that we have here a formal version
of a primitive mimetic performance. Viçvanātha gives as example the <i>Līlāmadhukara</i>; the <i>Çāradātilaka</i> is one of the best known.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>The garland, Vīthī,<a class="noteRef" id="n349.1src" href="#n349.1">145</a> has a certain similarity to the Bhāṇa in that it includes frequent speeches in the
air, and is in one act. But it is played by one or two actors, or, according to Viçvanātha
on one view found in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, by three, one of each station in rank. The leading sentiment is the erotic, but
others are hinted at. The graceful manner is forbidden by the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, but enjoined by the other authorities, and the elements of the garland are available.
Only the first and last junctures are employed, but all the elements of the plot are
present. The theorists are sadly at a loss to explain the name garland; it is suggested
that the several sentiments are gathered into it as into a garland, or the meaning
‘way’ or ‘road’ is accepted in lieu. The only example given by Viçvanātha is the <i>Mālavikā</i>, which is not the <i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i>; the first act of the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> is styled Bakulavīthī, but is in no sense even taken by itself an example of this
type.
</p>
<p>The later theory as seen in Viçvanātha<a class="noteRef" id="n349.2src" href="#n349.2">146</a> adds descriptions of eighteen minor forms of drama, Uparūpakas, which represent refinements
on the original scheme. Needless to say, though omitted in the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, quotations are found ascribing to Bharata the doctrine, though he mentions in them
but fifteen with several variations of name;<a class="noteRef" id="n349.3src" href="#n349.3">147</a> the <i>Agni Purāṇa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n349.4src" href="#n349.4">148</a> mentions eighteen with some variants of name, while a verse cited by Dhanika<a class="noteRef" id="n349.5src" href="#n349.5">149</a> names seven forms of mimetic dramas, which it classes in conjunction with the Bhāṇa.
The age of these divisions is, therefore, uncertain; the <i>Daçarūpa</i> condescends to mention only the Nāṭikā, but obviously knows of the existence of others,
confining its scope to the main forms, as its title indicates.
</p>
<p>The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n349.6src" href="#n349.6">150</a> mentions, in a passage suspected of interpolation, but without special cause, a type
of dramas Nāṭī, which later is styled Nāṭikā, or lesser heroic comedy. The subject-matter
in this view may be either legendary or invented; the later opinion requires it to
be invented as in the Prakaraṇa, which is the model for the Nāṭikā in this regard.
The hero is to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>that of the Nāṭaka, a gay king, and the intrigue consists of his efforts to attain
marriage with the heroine, who is an <i>ingénue</i> of royal family, whom he is destined to marry, but who by some accident or design
has been introduced into the harem in an inferior capacity. The lovers have to strive
against the jealousy of the queen, a lady of mature character and devotion to the
king, who at last is induced to sanction the nuptials. The life of the court gives
opportunity for introducing music, song, and the dance as elements in the entertainment.
The graceful manner is appropriate, and the erotic sentiment is prescribed; by an
excess of zeal, when the drama as usual has four acts, they are in theory to contain
each one of the four members of the graceful style. A lesser number of acts is allowed
by Dhanaṁjaya. There is certainly not much difference between such a Nāṭaka as the
<i>Mālavikāgnimitra</i> and the normal Nāṭikā, save the length, as expressed in the number of the acts, but
it would be unwise to assert that the distinction is based on this alone. It is a
fact that both in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> and the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> the poet has freely enough invented his episodes, and this is a fact justifying the
discrimination.
</p>
<p>The little bourgeois comedy, the Prakaraṇikā,<a class="noteRef" id="n350.1src" href="#n350.1">151</a> is precisely of the same character as the Nāṭikā, save that its hero and heroine
are of the merchant class. It is clear that it is due merely to a false desire for
symmetry, as it is merely a Prakaraṇa when judged by the three determinants of plot,
character, and sentiment, and Dhanika rightly rejects it as a species, though Viçvanātha
admits it.
</p>
<p>A variant of the Nāṭikā is the Saṭṭaka,<a class="noteRef" id="n350.2src" href="#n350.2">152</a> which differs from it merely by being all in Prākrit, in having no introductory scenes
of any kind, and in having the acts called Javanikāntara. As the name denotes a form
of dance, it is quite possible that it owes its origin as a species to the use of
such dances in these plays. We have an example in Rājaçekhara’s <i>Karpūramañjarī</i>.
</p>
<p>The Troṭaka<a class="noteRef" id="n350.3src" href="#n350.3">153</a> or Toṭaka is merely a variant of the Nāṭaka; the Bengālī recension of the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> which contains Apabhraṅça verses and an appropriate dance of the distracted <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>king alone gives the name. The term denotes both a dance and confused speech, and
the origin of the species need be sought only in this peculiarity. The other manuscripts
call it a Nāṭaka.
</p>
<p>The other species enumerated have no representatives in the old literature, nor is
this wonderful, for they show the character rather of pantomime with song, dance,
and music than of serious drama; the Goṣṭhī<a class="noteRef" id="n351.1src" href="#n351.1">154</a> has nine or ten men and five or six women as actors; the Hallīça<a class="noteRef" id="n351.2src" href="#n351.2">155</a> is clearly a glorified dance; the Nāṭyarāsaka<a class="noteRef" id="n351.3src" href="#n351.3">156</a> a ballet and pantomime; the Prasthāna,<a class="noteRef" id="n351.4src" href="#n351.4">157</a> in which hero and heroine are slaves, is based on a mimetic dance; so also apparently
are the Bhāṇikā,<a class="noteRef" id="n351.5src" href="#n351.5">158</a> or little Bhāṇa, and the Kāvya, both one-act pieces; the Rāsaka, of the same general
type, includes dialect in its language. The Ullāpya may have one or three acts, and
its hero is of high rank, while battles form part of its subject, as they do also
in the Saṁlāpaka, which may have one, three, or four acts. The Durmallikā has four
acts, a hero of low rank, and a precise time-table of duration of acts. The Vilāsikā
has one act, but is interesting in that the hero has, to support him, not only the
Vidūṣaka, but also the parasite and a friend (<i>pīṭhamarda</i>); the sentiment is erotic. The Çilpaka is mysterious, for it has four acts, allows
all the manners, has a Brahmin as hero with a man of lower rank as secondary hero,
excludes the calm and comic sentiments, and has twenty-seven most miscellaneous constituents;
if a pantomime, it was clearly not amusing. The Pren̄khaṇa, or Prekṣaṇa, is a piece
in one act, with a hero of low birth, full of combats and hard words; it has no introductory
scenes, and both the benediction and the Prarocanā are performed behind the scenes,
but none of the late works which bear approximately this title conforms to type. The
Çrīgadita is in a single act, the story legendary, the hero and heroine of high rank,
the manner verbal; the word Çrī is often mentioned, or the goddess is presented seated
and singing some verse. The only play known of that name is the <i>Subhadrāharaṇa</i> of Mādhava before <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1600, which is much like an ordinary play, but contains a narrative verse, suggesting
connexion with the shadow-drama. It is characteristic that the theory ignores wholly
this type.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">10.</span> <i>The Influence of Theory on Practice</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though we cannot say precisely at what date the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> obtained definite form, we can be assured that by the time of Kālidāsa it was not
merely known, but its authority was already accepted as binding on poets. The mere
fact that Kālidāsa’s dramas exhibit a marvellous fidelity to the rules of the Çāstra
might be explained by the theory that it drew its principles from them rather than
<i>vice versa</i>. But in his epics Kālidāsa, in due accord with the duty of a poet to display every
form of his erudition, has emphatically shown a far-reaching competence in the terminology
of the Çāstra. In the <i>Kumārasambhava</i><a class="noteRef" id="n352.1src" href="#n352.1">159</a> Çiva and Pārvatī watched the performance in honour of their nuptials of a Nāṭaka
in which the different dramatic manners were combined with the junctures, the modes
of the music corresponded with the sentiments, and the Apsarases displayed their grace
of form. There are similar references in the <i>Raghuvaṅça</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n352.2src" href="#n352.2">160</a> The knowledge of the Çāstra by later writers goes without saying. The author of the
<i>Mudrārākṣasa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n352.3src" href="#n352.3">161</a> depicts Rākṣasa as comparing political combinations with the work of a dramatist
and giving a brief plan of the structure of the drama, and Bhavabhūti<a class="noteRef" id="n352.4src" href="#n352.4">162</a> and Murāri<a class="noteRef" id="n352.5src" href="#n352.5">163</a> alike show familiarity with the terminology of the Çāstra as well as with its rules.
The most complete proof, however, of the domination of the theory is the absence of
any original creations in dramatic form. There must, it is certain, have been a time
when the genius of Indian poetry was active in trying and developing the new instrument
of drama, but with the appearance of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> this creative epoch came to all intents and purposes to a close, and the writers
of the classical drama accept without question the forms imposed upon them by authority,
although that authority rests on no logical or psychological basis, but represents
merely generalizations, often hasty, from a limited number of plays.
</p>
<p>The Nāṭaka, accordingly, remains the form of drama <i>par excellence</i>, a pre-eminence due to its comparative freedom from narrow <span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>restrictions as well as to the submissive spirit of the dramatists. The form serves
very different purposes; it accommodates itself not only to the grace and charm of
Kālidāsa, but to the unmeasured and irregular genius of Bhavabhūti; it permits of
the political drama of Viçākhadatta, as well as the philosophical disquisitions of
Kṛṣṇamiçra and the devotional fervour of Kavikarṇapūra’s <i>Caitanyacandrodaya</i>.
</p>
<p>The Prakaraṇa is essentially similar to the Nāṭaka save in the social status of the
hero and heroine; the distinction between the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> and a Nāṭaka is far less important than the similarity. The <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, indeed, departs from type, but that is not surprising now that it is known that
it is based on Bhāsa’s <i>Cārudatta</i>, which is not merely the work of a man of unusual talent, but came into being before
the rules of the drama had attained the binding force they later achieved. The Nāṭikā,
however, which is likewise closely allied to the Nāṭaka, became stereotyped at an
early stage, leaving no room for serious innovation; the charms of the song and dance
appear to have prevailed, and to have dissuaded efforts at originality of plot. The
Vyāyoga is hardly more than an aspect of the Nāṭaka; the spirit of such works as those
of Bhāsa in this genre is reflected in many passages of the <i>Mahāvīracarita</i> and the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i>.
</p>
<p>The farce and the monologue, of which we have many specimens in the later drama, are
confined to representations of the lower and coarser side of life, but curiously enough
they fail entirely to achieve what might have seemed the legitimate aim of a vivid
portrayal of the lives and manners of contemporary society; tradition has proved too
strong for the dramatists whose works deal with types, not individuals. On the other
hand, we find practically no living tradition of the construction of dramas of the
other five classes of the theory, Ḍima, Samavakāra, Īhāmṛga, Vīthī, and Utsṛṣṭikān̄ka.
We may legitimately assume that these were types erected on little foundation of fact,
and that, while the theory could restrict enterprise, it could not induce life in
forms which had no real vitality of their own. The mere fact that later poets occasionally
patronize these forms is sufficient evidence of the strength of the authority of the
Çāstra. It is amazing, however, that we find no serious effort to produce <span class="pageNum" id="pb354">[<a href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>pure comedy; the farce and the monologue may hover on the borders of that form; they
certainly never attain it.
</p>
<p>To the force of the tradition is presumably to be ascribed the absence of any effort
at tragedy, though its absence undoubtedly coincides with the mental outlook of the
Indian people and their philosophy of life. Bhāsa has indeed been claimed as a tragedian,
but with complete disregard for the facts; there is in fact in his dramas disregard
of the rule which objects to death on the stage, but the slain are always evil men,
whose death is just punishment; the <i>Ūrubhan̄ga</i> may to us be tragic, but that is because we are not adorers of Viṣṇu who regard with
relish the fate of the enemy of that god, the evil Duryodhana. The tragic sentiment
is nowhere recognized, for the term (<i>raudra</i>), which is unhappily often so rendered, is the sentiment which is based on anger,
and has nothing truly tragic in it. The idea is, indeed, entirely wanting in the theory
as it is in the practice.
</p>
<p>To the developed thought of India, as it existed during the vogue of the drama, there
was little possibility of a realization of the elements of which Greek tragedy is
composed. The conception of human activity striving with circumstance, endeavouring
to assert itself in the teeth of forces superhuman in power and uncontrollable, and
meeting with utter ruin, but yet maintaining its honour, which affords the spring
of tragedy in Greece, is alien to Indian thought. Fate is nothing outside man; he
is subject to no alien influences; he is what he has made himself by acts in past
lives; if he suffers evil he has deserved it as just retribution, and to sympathize
with him, to feel the pathos of his plight, is really unthinkable. Death, therefore,
by violence is merely a just punishment of crime, and it is a more refined taste than
that of Bhāsa which bids us banish from the stage the spectacle of what is no more
than an execution, a scene as ill-suited to the decorum and good taste of the serious
drama<a class="noteRef" id="n354.1src" href="#n354.1">164</a> as to the rude merriment of the farce or monologue.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">11.</span> <i>Aristotle and the Indian Theory of Poetics</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is natural that contemporaneously with the effort to prove the Greek origin of
the Indian drama efforts<a class="noteRef" id="n355.1src" href="#n355.1">165</a> should have been made to establish the indebtedness of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> to Aristotle’s theory of drama.<a class="noteRef" id="n355.2src" href="#n355.2">166</a> There is no doubt of the many parallels between the two theories. The unity of action
is fully recognized in the Çāstra, and the rule which insists that the events described
in an Act shall not exceed in duration a day has a certain similarity to the unity
of time in Aristotle,<a class="noteRef" id="n355.3src" href="#n355.3">167</a> and is much more significant than such agreement as there is as to unity of place.
The doctrine that the drama is an imitation (<i>anukṛti</i>) does not differ from the doctrine of Mimesis, but there is an essential distinction
in what is imitated or represented; in the Çāstra it is a state or condition, in Aristotle
it is action, a distinction absolutely in accord with the different geniuses of the
two peoples. The importance of acting is common in both schemes, but Aristotle makes
little of the dance. Both stress the plot, which the Çāstra recognizes as the body
of the drama. The Indian division of characters as high, middle, and low has a certain
parallelism to the Aristotelian distinctions of modes of depicting character as ideal,
real, and inferior. The Çāstra, like Aristotle, shows appreciation of the distinction
between male and female characters. To some degree we find in the Çāstra the recognition
of the necessity of conflict in drama, and of the emotions of pity and fear in the
sentiment of pathos and in the element of the development known as Vidrava. The Çāstra
also touches on the relation of the feelings aroused in the actor and in the audience
as in the <i>Poetics</i>. Both recognize the use of significant names, and deal with the linguistic aspects
of style.
</p>
<p>Other suggestions of Greek influence may also be adduced; thus we have the mention
of what seems a derivative of the Greek caryatides in the description of the theatre;
the monologue may be based on the Greek Mime, and we have the actual <span class="pageNum" id="pb356">[<a href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>mention in a passage of the Çāstra of Yavanas, while the description of the Viṭa suggests
derivation from the Greek parasite. But it is impossible to take these pieces of evidence
as conclusive proof of borrowing; we are, in fact, faced with the usual difficulty
that, if there were borrowing, the Indian genius has known how to recast so cleverly
and to adapt what it borrowed so effectively that the traces which would definitely
establish indebtedness cannot be found. In all the instances enumerated there is no
doubt similarity, but there is also essential difference such as renders independent
development of the Indian doctrine at least as probable as borrowing.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">1.</span> <i>The Theatre</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sanskrit drama of the theorists is, despite its complexity, essentially intended
for performance, nor is there the slightest doubt that the early dramatists were anything
but composers of plays meant only to be read. They were connoisseurs, we may be certain,
in the merits which would accrue to their works from the accessories of the dance,
music, song, and the attractions of acting; the <i>Vikramorvaçī</i> must, for instance, have had much of the attraction of an opera, and as a mere literary
work loses seriously in attraction.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the existence of regular theatres for the exhibition of drama is
not assumed in the theorists. A drama was, it is clear, normally performed on an occasion
of special rejoicing and solemnity, such as a festival of a god, or a royal marriage,
or the celebration of a victory, and the place of performance thus naturally came
to be the temple of the god or the palace of the king. We learn often in the drama
and tales of the existence of dancing halls and music rooms in the royal palace where
the ladies of the harem were taught these pleasing arts, and one of these could easily
be adapted for a dramatic performance. But we have from the second century B.C. the
remains of a cave which seems to have been used, if not for the performance of plays,
at any rate for purposes of recitation of poems or some similar end; it is found in
the Rāmgarh hill<a class="noteRef" id="n358.1src" href="#n358.1">1</a> in Chota Nagpur, and, although it is quite impossible to prove that it had anything
to do with plays, it is interesting to note that the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> states that the play-house should have the form of a mountain cave and two stories.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to the Çāstra,<a class="noteRef" id="n359.1src" href="#n359.1">2</a> the play-house as made ready for performance may be of three types, the first for
the gods, 108 hands (18 inches) long; the second rectangular, 64 hands long and 32
broad; the third triangular, 32 hands long, the second being praised on acoustic grounds.
The house falls into two parts, the places for the audience and the stage. The auditorium
is marked off by pillars, in front a white pillar for the seats for the Brahmins,
then a red pillar for the Kṣatriyas, in the north-west a yellow pillar marks the seats
for the Vaiçyas, while the Çūdras have a blue-black pillar in the north-east. The
seats are of wood and bricks, and arranged in rows. In front beside the stage is a
veranda with four pillars, apparently also for the use of spectators. In front of
the spectators is the stage (<i>ran̄ga</i>), adorned with pictures and reliefs; it is eight hands square in the second form
of play-house; its end is the head of the stage (<i>ran̄gaçīrṣa</i>), decorated by figures, and there offerings are made.<a class="noteRef" id="n359.2src" href="#n359.2">3</a>
</p>
<p>Behind<a class="noteRef" id="n359.3src" href="#n359.3">4</a> the stage is the painted curtain (<i>paṭī</i>, <i>apaṭī</i>, <i>tiraskaraṇī</i>, <i>pratisīrā</i>), to which the name Yavanikā (Prākrit, Javanikā) is given, denoting merely that the
material is foreign, and forbidding any conclusion as to the Greek origin of the curtain
itself or the theatre. When one enters hastily, the curtain is violently thrown aside
(<i>apaṭīkṣepa</i>). Behind the curtain are the actors’ quarters (<i lang="und">nepathyagṛha</i>) or tiring rooms. Here are performed the sounds necessary to represent uproar and
confusion which cannot be represented on the stage; here also are uttered the voices
of gods and other persons whose presence on the stage is impossible or undesirable.
</p>
<p>The colour of the curtain is given in some authorities as necessarily in harmony with
the dominant sentiment of the play, in accordance with the classification of sentiments
already given, but others permit the use of red in every instance. Normally the entry
of any character is effected by the drawing aside of the curtain by two maidens, whose
beauty marks them out for this <span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>employment (<i>dhṛtir yavanikāyāḥ</i>). The term Nepathya has suggested an erroneous deduction as to the relative elevation
of the stage and the foyer, for it is conceivable that it denotes a descending (<i>ni-patha</i>) way, and it has been concluded<a class="noteRef" id="n360.1src" href="#n360.1">5</a> that it was, therefore, below the level of the stage. But the regular phrase of the
entry of an actor on the stage (<i>ran̄gāvataraṇa</i>) would suggest exactly the opposite, a descent from the foyer to the stage. In the
case of stages hastily put together, often for merely very temporary aims, it would
clearly be absurd to expect any fixed practice, nor can we say what was the normal
height of the stage platform. In the case of a play within a play, in the <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> of Rājaçekhara, we find that both a stage and a tiring room are erected on the original
stage, though we may assume that these were of a very simple structure.
</p>
<p>The number of doors leading to the tiring room from the stage is regularly given as
two,<a class="noteRef" id="n360.2src" href="#n360.2">6</a> and apparently the place of the orchestra was between them.
</p>
</div>

<div id="ch14.2" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd32e1205">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Actors</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The normal term for actor is Naṭa, a term which has the wider sense of dancer or acrobat;
terms like Bharata, or Bhārata, Cāraṇa,<a class="noteRef" id="n360.3src" href="#n360.3">7</a> Kuçīlava, Çailūṣa, or Çaubhika have interest practically only for the history of
the drama. The chief actor, whose name Sūtradhāra doubtless denotes him as primarily
the architect of the theatre, the man who secures the erection of the temporary stage,
is occasionally styled ‘troop-head of actors (<i>naṭagāmaṇi</i>)’,<a class="noteRef" id="n360.4src" href="#n360.4">8</a> and he is essentially the instructor of the other actors in their art (<i>nāṭyācārya</i>), so that his title Sūtradhāra can be used topically as equivalent to Professor.
For this high position his qualifications were to be numerous; he was supposed to
be learned in all the arts and sciences, to be acquainted with the habits and customs
of all lands, to combine the completeness of technical knowledge with practical skill,
and to be possessed of all the <span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span>moral qualities which an Indian genius can enumerate. To him falls not merely the
very important function of introducing the play, but also of taking one of the chief
parts; thus he plays Vatsa in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, and in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> Kāmandakī, the nun, who powerfully affects the current of the drama. He is normally
the husband of one of the actresses (<i>naṭī</i>), who aids him in the opening scene, and who is compelled, poor woman, to combine
the arduous life of an actress with the domestic duty of looking after her husband’s
material wants. She is represented as devoted to him, fasting to secure reunion in
another life, preparing his meal and seeking to remove by her good works the dangers
which threaten him, and compelled to play her parts, although anxious, as in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i>, over the difficulty of securing the marriage of her daughter to a fiancé who has
gone overseas, or, as in the <i>Jānakīpariṇaya</i>, over the wickedness of another actor in seeking to take her daughter from her.
</p>
<p>The Sthāpaka, according to the theory, is to resemble in his attributes the Sūtradhāra;
as we have seen, to what extent he really in the dramas known to us was employed as
distinct from the Sūtradhāra, it is impossible to say; the name suggests that he aided
him in the structure of the stage, and then in his actor’s duties. But there is no
ground to assume that he really had disappeared as a living figure before the classical
drama; the occasional mention of him in actual dramas as well as in the theory need
not be artificial. We have, however, a much more common attendant of the Sūtradhāra
in the Pāripārçvika, who appears in the prologue of many plays, and in addition acted
the parts of persons of middle rank. He receives the orders of his master and passes
them on to the other actors, and directs the operations of the chorus, as in the <i>Veṇīsaṁhāra</i>. He is addressed by his master as Mārṣa, and he greets him as Bhāva.
</p>
<p>The other actors, of whom there must often have been many in pieces with crowds introduced,
are to have the qualities of the Sūtradhāra in as generous a measure as may be; they
are divided, however, according to their qualifications into superior, medium, and
third-rate actors.<a class="noteRef" id="n361.1src" href="#n361.1">9</a> The principal parts in any drama are, however, few; the king, the Vidūṣaka, the parasite,
the heroine, and a companion are stock types. The division of <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>rôles is seldom shown in the prologues, whence are derived most of the details of
our knowledge of actual performances. The Sūtradhāra in the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> and the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> plays the part of Vatsa, his younger brother that of Yaugandharāyaṇa in the former
play and that of Dṛḍhavarman in the latter; the Sūtradhāra and the Pāripārçvika take
in the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i> the rôles of Kāmandakī and her pupil Avalokitā respectively. This taking of women’s
parts by men is not by any means the normal practice; the Naṭī normally plays an important
female part;<a class="noteRef" id="n362.1src" href="#n362.1">10</a> in the embryo drama in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i> we find that the heroine’s part is played by Āraṇyikā, and the hero’s part was to
have been performed by another girl Manoramā, but Vatsa, without the queen’s knowledge,
insinuated himself into the scene <i lang="la">in propria persona</i>. In the legend of Bharata’s exhibition of the <i>Lakṣmīsvayaṁvara</i> the nymph Urvaçī is represented as playing the chief rôle, and in Dāmodaragupta’s
<i>Kuṭṭanīmata</i>, where an actual representation of the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> is described, we find a woman in the rôle of the princess. The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n362.2src" href="#n362.2">11</a> expressly admits of three modes of representation; the rôles may be filled by persons
of appropriate sex and age; the rôles of the old may be taken by the young and <i>vice versa</i>; and the rôles of men may be played by women and <i>vice versa</i>. The taking of women’s parts by men has, curiously enough, a very early piece of
evidence, for the <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> mentions the word Bhrūkuṅsa, which was used to denote a man who made up as a female.<a class="noteRef" id="n362.3src" href="#n362.3">12</a>
</p>
<p>We are, it is clear, to conceive of the troupe of actors under the Sūtradhāra as ready
to wander hither and thither in search of a favourable opportunity of exhibiting their
powers as interpreters. The performance of a drama became, it is clear, in later times
at any rate, a worthy adornment of a festive occasion such as a religious festival,
the consecration of a king, a marriage, the taking possession of a town or a new estate,
the return of a traveller, and the birth of a son. The best patrons of the actors
might be kings, but there was evidently no lack of appreciation of their services
among men of lesser rank but of large means. The later prologues give us details of
the rivalry between different troupes. In the <i>Anargharāghava</i> the actor declares that <span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>he has come to exhibit a superior sort of drama to that played by a rival, and asserts
that the dearest desire of a player is to satisfy the public and to win back the favour
he has lost. Rājaçekhara twice introduces the motive of a competition between actors
to win the hand of an actress who has been offered by her father in marriage to the
most adept of her suitors. Jayadeva invents a pleasing tale of an actor who won great
success and reputation, inducing a comedian of the south to claim his name and steal
his renown. The actor in revenge went south, and, striking up a partnership with a
singer, won both repute and profit in the courts of the Deccan.
</p>
<p>The reputation of actors and actresses was low and unsavoury; they are reputed to
live on the price of their wives’ honour (<i>jāyājīva</i>, <i>rūpājīva</i>), and Manu imposes only a minor penalty on illicit relations with the wife of an
actor on the score of their willingness to hand over their wives to others and profit
by their dishonour.<a class="noteRef" id="n363.1src" href="#n363.1">13</a> The <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> gives equally clear testimony of the lack of chastity among the actresses or their
predecessors.<a class="noteRef" id="n363.2src" href="#n363.2">14</a> The law book of Viṣṇu<a class="noteRef" id="n363.3src" href="#n363.3">15</a> treats them as Āyogavas, a mixed caste representing the fruit of alliances, improper
and undesirable, between Çūdras and the daughters of the Vaiçya; to be an actor or
a teacher of the art is ranked as a lesser sin in Baudhāyana.<a class="noteRef" id="n363.4src" href="#n363.4">16</a> The Kuçīlava is described as a Çūdra, who ought to be banished;<a class="noteRef" id="n363.5src" href="#n363.5">17</a> his evidence, and indeed that of any actor, is not to be accepted in law,<a class="noteRef" id="n363.6src" href="#n363.6">18</a> and Brahmins may not accept food offered by an actor,<a class="noteRef" id="n363.7src" href="#n363.7">19</a> a fact attested by the Sūtradhāra in the prologue to the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> who can find no one in Ujjayinī to accept his hospitality. Actors again are classed
in Manu with wrestlers and boxers. An actress was often, if not necessarily, one of
the great army of courtesans; Vasantasenā, the hetaera of the <i>Cārudatta</i> and <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i>, is herself skilled in acting, and has in her household maidens learning to act,
and Daṇḍin includes lessons in this art in his account of the education of the perfect
courtesan in the <i>Daçakumāracarita</i>.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have traces of a higher side of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb364">[<a href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>profession, which doubtless can quite fairly be connected with the gradual elevation
of the drama from humble origins to the rank of an elaborate and refined poetry. Bharata,
the alleged founder of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>, ranks as a Muni, or holy sage, and Urvaçī, a divine nymph, is treated as an actress.
What is more important is that Bāṇa definitely enumerates in the <i>Harṣacarita</i> among his friends an actor and an actress; Bhartṛhari<a class="noteRef" id="n364.1src" href="#n364.1">20</a> refers to their friendship with kings, which is also attested in the legend of Vasumitra,
son of Kālidāsa’s hero Agnimitra, who was slain amidst his actors by his enemy. Kālidāsa
himself represents Agnivarṇa, king of Raghu’s line, as pleased to compete with actors
in their own speciality. Vatsa, in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i>, is prepared to play a part without question, and Bhavabhūti in two of his prefaces
asserts his friendship with his actors. In truth, men who could effectively declaim
the stanzas of Bhavabhūti must have possessed both education and culture in a high
degree, and have been very different from the acrobats and jugglers, dancers, and
others whose humble occupations account for the censures of the law books and the
<i>Arthaçāstra</i>.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have no trace in the drama of any attempt to introduce scenery into the representation.
The curtain remained as a background throughout the entertainment, and it was in the
main left to the imagination of the spectator, aided by the descriptions of the poet,
to conceive the beauties of the situation supposed to be presented to his eyes. We
have for this conclusive proof, if any were needed beyond the silence of the text-books,
in the abundant stage directions which accompany the text of our dramas, and are found
even in the fragments of Açvaghoṣa. When actions such as watering a plant were ascribed
to an actress, no serious effort was made to bring in plants and perform the ceremonial
of watering; on the contrary, she went through a mimicry of the process, which was
enough to satisfy the audience. The king may mount a chariot, but no effort is made
to bring one for this purpose; he merely goes in <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>elaborate pantomime through the action of getting up off the ground, and the audience,
trained and intelligent, realizes what has happened. At the beginning of the <i>Çakuntalā</i> the gazelle which Duḥṣanta follows is not a real animal, but the Sūtradhāra tells
us that the king is pursuing a gazelle, and the actor, who represents the monarch,
by his eager gaze and his gestures reveals himself as in the act of seeking to shoot
the deer. To pluck flowers is merely to imitate the movements of one who really does
so, and an actress with any skill has no difficulty in persuading an audience by her
marks of agitation that she is escaping from the attacks of a bee.
</p>
<p>There is thus no tedious attempt at realism, though the dramatists vary in the care
with which they avoid the absurd in their use of conventions; the works of Bhāsa show
doubtless an excessive tendency to allow of strain being placed on the credulity of
the audience. The exits and entrances of the characters are often abrupt and unnatural,
but the drama was not primarily intended as a realistic copy of events, and doubtless
was not felt unsatisfactory by the audience. Nor, it may be remembered, has perfection
in detail in any form of ceremonial ever made a strong appeal to Indian minds; in
the most gorgeous celebrations there will occur, without exciting surprise or comment,
strange deviations from western canons of good taste and elegance.
</p>
<p>To a limited extent, however, use was made of minor properties, which are classed
under the generic style of model work (<i>pusta</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n365.1src" href="#n365.1">21</a> The <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e13910" title="Source: Nātyaçāstra">Nāṭyaçāstra</span></i> distinguishes three forms of such objects; they may be made up (<i>sandhima</i>) from bamboos covered with skins or cloths; or mechanical means might be employed
(<i>vyājima</i>); or merely clothes (<i>veṣṭita</i>) used. We hear of the making of an elephant in the <i>Udayanacarita</i>; the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> owes its name to the toy cart which appears in it; the <i>Bālarāmāyaṇa</i> has mechanical dolls, and doubtless there were represented houses, caves, chariots,
rocks, horses, and so on; monsters with animal heads and many arms could be made of
clay and bamboos, and covered with cloths; we are expressly told that weapons must
not be made of hard material, but that <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>stocks of grass, bamboos, and lac may be made to serve, and naturally gestures served
in lieu of hard blows.
</p>
<p>The dress<a class="noteRef" id="n366.1src" href="#n366.1">22</a> of the actors is carefully regulated, especially as regards colour, which evidently
was regarded as an important item in matters of sentiment. Ascetics wear garments
of rags or bark; those in charge in the harem red jackets, kings gay garments or,
if there are portents described, garments without colour. Ābhīra maidens wear dark
blue clothes; in other cases dirty or uncoloured garments are prescribed. Dirty clothes
indicate madness, distraction, misery, or a journey; uncoloured garb, one engaged
in worship or some solemn religious service, an interesting survival of antique custom,
while gods, Dānavas, Gandharvas, Uragas, Yakṣas, and Rakṣases, as well as lovers and
kings, normally wear gay clothing.
</p>
<p>Colour,<a class="noteRef" id="n366.2src" href="#n366.2">23</a> however, is by no means confined to garments; the actors are expected to adorn themselves
with paint of hues appropriate to the rôles they play. There are, on one theory, four
fundamental colours, white, blue-black, red, and yellow, from which others are developed,
for instance pigeon colour by mixing the first two; a reddish yellow (<i>gaura</i>) from mixing the last two is also recorded. It or dark (<i>çyāma</i>) is given as suited for kings, while happiness is indicated by it. Kirātas, Barbaras,
Andhras, Draviḍas, the people of Kāçi and Kosala, Pulindas, and the people of the
Deccan are to be black (<i>asita</i>); the Çakas, Yavanas, Pahlavas, and Bālhikas<a class="noteRef" id="n366.3src" href="#n366.3">24</a> are to be reddish yellow; Pāñcālas, Çūrasenas, Māhiṣas, Uḍras, Māgadhas, An̄gas,
Van̄gas, and Kalin̄gas are to be dark (<i>çyāma</i>), as also Vaiçyas and Çūdras in general, while Brahmins and Kṣatriyas are to be reddish-yellow.
</p>
<p>Naturally the hair<a class="noteRef" id="n366.4src" href="#n366.4">25</a> attracts attention; Piçācas, madmen, and Bhūtas wear it loose; the Vidūṣaka is bald;
boys have three tufts of hair, and so also servants if it is not cut short; the maidens
of Avantī, and usually those of Bengal, wear ringlets, in the case of women of the
north it is worn high on the head, and otherwise plaits are usual. The beard may be
bright in hue, dark, or bushy. There is also the same tendency to stereotype <span class="pageNum" id="pb367">[<a href="#pb367">367</a>]</span>the ornaments, made out of copper, mica, or wax, and the garlands carried by the various
personages; Vidyādharīs, Yakṣīs, Apsarases and Nāgīs carry pearls and jewels, while
the latter are at once recognizable by the snake’s hood rising over their heads, as
are Yakṣas by a large tuft of hair.
</p>
<p>The dress and appearance of the actor thus serve in some measure to carry out his
duty of representation (<i>abhinaya</i>), of presenting before our eyes the states or <span class="corr" id="xd32e13965" title="Source: conkitions">conditions</span> of the personage for whom he stands. This is the Āhāryābhinaya, the first of the
four agencies enumerated by the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i>. He has also to perform the duty of representation by speech (<i>vācika</i>), using his voice to convey the dramatist’s words, and by exhibiting <i lang="la">in propria persona</i> the appropriate physical counterparts of the feelings and emotions of the characters
(<i>sāttvikābhinaya</i>). Finally, he has specially to concentrate on the expression by gesture (<i>ān̄gikābhinaya</i>) of the feelings which he is supposed to experience. In this regard most detailed
rules are given, doubtless from the technique of a period when more importance attached
to gestures than later seems natural. Each member of the body is singled out for description;
deep significance lies in the mode in which the head is shaken, the eyes glance, the
brows move; cheek, nose, lip, chin, and neck can all be used to convey subtle senses.
The hands are invaluable for this purpose; the different manœuvres with the fingers
can convey almost any possible combination of meanings to the person sufficiently
acquainted with the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> to understand them. But other parts of the body down to the feet are valuable; great
care is bestowed on their postures, and the gait is invaluable in distinguishing classes
of persons and their deeds. Darkness need not artificially be induced; movements of
hands and feet to indicate groping are enough; one set of movements shows the mounting
of a chariot, another the climbing up to the top of a palace; if the garments are
pulled up, the crossing of a river is plainly shown; if the motions of swimming are
mimicked, clearly the river is too deep to wade; a dexterous movement of the hands
shows that one is driving, and similarly one can mount an elephant or a horse.<a class="noteRef" id="n367.1src" href="#n367.1">26</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb368">[<a href="#pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is characteristic of the nature of the Indian theory that, while it descends into
enormous detail, it leaves alone to all intents and purposes the obvious duty of defining
precisely the relation of the varieties of representation described as Sāttvika and
Ān̄gika. The true relation is that under the head of Sāttvika are described the physical
states, which are deemed appropriate to feelings and emotions, while the Ān̄gika prescribes
the precise physical movements which express most effectively both psychic states
and physical movements, which cannot be conveniently presented on the stage. The division
accordingly is unscientific, and, acute as is the investigation of the <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i> in detail, it is far from satisfying as a whole.
</p>
<p>The importance of such accessories to the representation as garlands, ornaments, and
appropriate garments, is emphasized by Mātṛgupta, who admits a specific form of sentiment
styled Nepathyarasa, a fact which illustrates the effect produced in the mind of the
spectator by the details of the <i>mise-en-scène</i>. The same impression may be derived from the elaboration of the stage directions
in the dramas, comparable only to such as are given, for instance, in Mr. Bernard
Shaw’s productions. It is clear that they were intended not only for the direction
of the actors in actually performing one of the pieces, but as instruments to aid
the reader of the drama in realizing mentally the form of the representation and in
appreciating, therefore, the dramatic quality of what he studied. Moreover, we have
independent evidence which aids us in seeing how complete these directions are. A
fortunate chance has preserved in Dāmodaragupta’s <i>Kuṭṭanīmata</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n368.1src" href="#n368.1">27</a> written in the reign of Jayāpīḍa of Kashmir in the eighth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, an account of the performance of the <i>Ratnāvalī</i> of Harṣa. The description is incomplete, but it is perfectly clear that it was played
exactly in accordance with the stage directions which have come down to us, embedded
in the text of the drama as we have it.
</p>
<p>The actual performance of the play was preceded, as we have seen in describing the
theory of the drama, by preliminaries, the essential aim of which was the securing
of the favour of the gods for the play to be represented. Of the varied elements of
the preliminaries special importance seems to have attached to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb369">[<a href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>praise of the world guardians (<i>dikpālastuti</i>), and the reverence paid to Indra’s banner. A reed with five knots is selected which
is called Jarjara; the five sections are painted white, blue-black, yellow, red, and
a mixture of hues; banners of every colour are tied to it, and the supplication is
made to Gaṇeça, the god who removes obstacles and favours literature, and to the guardians
of the quarters of the world.
</p>
<p>A religious aspect is given also to the mingling of the pigments, the materials employed
being yellow arsenic, lamp black, and red among others. The arsenic is formally addressed
as being created by Svayambhū for the purpose of serving as a pigment; then it is
placed on a board with fragments of brick, the whole reduced to fine powder, and mingled,
and then used as pigment.<a class="noteRef" id="n369.1src" href="#n369.1">28</a>
</p>
<p>The time of the performance is not in many cases stated, but in a number of plays,
including the <i>Mālatīmādhava</i>, <i>Karṇasundarī</i>, and the embryo drama in the <i>Priyadarçikā</i>, we find it assumed to be the moment when the sun is just appearing.<a class="noteRef" id="n369.2src" href="#n369.2">29</a> The beat of drum announces the beginning of the drama, the preliminaries, often reduced
to little more than a vocal and instrumental concert of brief duration, are completed,
and the benediction pronounced, to be followed by the prologue proper and the drama.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> <i>The Audience</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A drama like the Sanskrit demanded the full attention of a cultivated audience, and
it is assumed or expressly asserted, as in the dramas of Kālidāsa, Harṣa, and Bhavabhūti,
that the spectators are critical and experienced. The <i>Nāṭyaçāstra</i><a class="noteRef" id="n369.3src" href="#n369.3">30</a> requires from the ideal spectator (<i>prekṣaka</i>) keen susceptibility and excellent judgement, with ability to make his own the feelings
and emotions of the characters depicted by the actors. But it is admitted that there
are the usual degrees among the spectators, good, medium, and indifferent; the question
of the success of a drama depends on the judgement of the critic <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>(<i>prāçnika</i>), who is to possess every possible good quality to fit him for the delicate task.
The audience, as it is to share the feelings of the characters, is expected to show
them by the usual outward signs; laughter, tears, cries, hair standing on end, jumping
up from their seats, clapping with the hands and other manifestations of pleasure,
horror, fear, and other sentiments are both proper and natural.
</p>
<p>The rules for placing the patron at whose bidding the drama is performed, Sabhāpati,
and his guests, are elaborate.<a class="noteRef" id="n370.1src" href="#n370.1">31</a> He sits himself on the Lion Throne, the equivalent of the royal box, with the ladies
of his harem on the left, and on the right the personages of highest importance, such
as the vassal princes of a great king like Harṣa. Behind the latter are the treasurer
and other officers, and near them the learned men of the court, civil and religious,
including the poets, and in their midst the astrologers and physicians. On the left
again are the ministers and other courtiers; all around are maidens of the court.
In front again of the king are Brahmins, behind the bearers of fans, radiant in youthful
beauty. On the left in front are the reciters and panegyrists, eloquent and wise.
Guards are present to protect the sacred person of the sovereign.
</p>
<p>How far the dramas were viewed by the public in general we cannot say; the rules regarding
the play-house contemplate the presence of Çūdras, but that is a vague term, and may
apply to a very restricted class of royal hangers on. We have the general rule<a class="noteRef" id="n370.2src" href="#n370.2">32</a> that barbarians, ignorant people, heretics, and those of low class should not be
admitted, but such prescriptions mean very little. There must, it is clear, have been
the utmost variation in the character of the audience according to the place and circumstances
of representation. At great festivals, when plays were given in the temples, there
must have been admission for as many as could be crowded in; in private exhibitions
the audience may well have been more select. The fact that the dramas must have been
largely unintelligible to all save a select few of the audience would not matter much;
a drama was essentially a spectacle; in many cases its subject was perfectly familiar
to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371">371</a>]</span>audience, and the elaborate use of conventional signs must have been enough to aid
many of the audience in following roughly the nature of the proceedings.
</p>
<p>When such dramatic exhibitions became rare we do not know; it is certain that in the
eleventh century in Kashmir they were not uncommon; Kṣemendra advised aspirants to
poetic fame to improve their taste by the study of such representations.<a class="noteRef" id="n371.1src" href="#n371.1">33</a> Doubtless the Mahomedan conquest seriously affected the vogue of the classical drama,
which was obnoxious to Mahomedan fanaticism as being closely identified both with
the national religion and the national spirit of India. The kings, who had been the
main support of the actors and poets alike, disappeared from their thrones or suffered
grave reverses in fortune. The tradition of dramatic performances gradually vanished.
Other causes contributed to this end; the divorce between the language of the stage
and that of the people steadily increasing with the passage of time made the Sanskrit
drama more and more remote to the public, and the Mahomedans made it lose its position
as the expression of the official and court life of the highest circles.<a class="noteRef" id="n371.2src" href="#n371.2">34</a>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n371.2src">34</a></span> A certain revival of displays occurred in the nineteenth century; e.g. the <i>Citrayajña</i> of Vaidyanātha Vācaspati Bhaṭṭācārya, written for the festival of Govinda by request
of the Rājā of Nadiyā about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1820. The Cakkyars of Malabar still act Çaktibhadra’s <i>Āçcaryamañjarī</i> and Kulaçekharavarman’s plays, as well as Act III of the <i>Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa</i>, under the style of <i>Mantrān̄kanāṭaka</i>, and the <i>Nāgānanda</i>; JRAS. 1910, p. 637; <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i> (ed. TSS.), p. xl; A.&nbsp;K. and V.&nbsp;R. Pisharoti, <i>Bulletin of <span class="corr" id="xd32e14097" title="Not in source">the </span>School of Oriental Studies</i>, III. i. 107 ff., who maintain the impossible view that Bhāsa’s plays are compilations
or adaptations of the eighth century, or later, holding that the <i>Cārudatta</i> is an adaptation of the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e14103" title="Source: Mẹcchakaṭikā">Mṛcchakaṭikā</span></i> (contrast p. 131), the <i>Pratimānāṭaka</i> is later than Kālidāsa, and the <i>Avimāraka</i> than Daṇḍin. The genealogy of Rāma in the <i>Pratimā</i> (iv. 9 f.) is that of Kālidāsa, but is also Purāṇic, and Daṇḍin, of course, is not
the inventor of the Kathā. Barnett (<i>Bulletin</i>, III. i. 35) accepts Pisharoti’s views, holding the <i>Nyāyaçāstra</i> of Medhātithi (<i>Pratimā</i>, v. 8/9) to be the <i>Manubhāṣya</i> (tenth century), but this is wholly against the context, and Barnett’s view is surely
incompatible with the priority of the <i>Cārudatta</i> to the <i>Mṛcchakaṭikā</i> which he admits, and the absence of Māhārāṣṭrī. Cf. also p. 341.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n371.2src" title="Return to note 34 in text.">↑</a></p>
